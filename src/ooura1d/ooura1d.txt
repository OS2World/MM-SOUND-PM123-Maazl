OOURA1D.DLL contains code found in the 1 dimension DFT / DCT / DST package
by Takuya OOURA <ooura@kurims.kyoto-u.ac.jp> or <ooura@mmm.t.u-tokyo.ac.jp>,
who owns the copyright.  Thanks to him for the nice code!

I have replaced all double precision floats to single precision.  It gives
an awful e-07 precision instead of e-17, but it's faster and e-07 is by far
enough for my needs.
