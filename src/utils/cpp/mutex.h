/*****************************************************************************
*
*  generic mutual exclusive section class
*
*  This is general mutex semaphore for use inside and outside the current
*  process. The Mutex can be inherited by fork() or in case of a named mutex
*  by simply using the same name.
*
*  usage:
*    Mutex mu;
*    ...
*    { Mutex::Lock lock(mu); // disable thread switching
*      ...                   // critical code section
*    }                       // release semaphore
*
*  named Mutex:
*    Mutex mu("MySpecialMutex");
*    ...
*    { Mutex::Lock lock(mu); // thread switching
*      ...                   // critical code section
*    }                       // release semaphore
*
*  usage:
*  - Create Mutex object at a shared memory location, e.g. as class
*    member, or pass the object's reference.
*      Mutex cs;
*  - To enter a critical section simply create an instance of
*    Mutex::Lock. The constructor will wait until the resource
*    becomes available. The destrurctor will release the semaphore when the
*    Lock object goes out of scope. This is particularly useful when
*    exceptions are cought outside the scope of the critical section.
*      { Mutex::Lock lo(cs); // aquire semaphore
*        ...                 // critical code section
*      }                     // release semaphore
*  - To check if the resource is successfully aquired after performing a timed
*    wait, simply query lo as boolean.
*      if (lo) ...
*  - If the scope dependency of the Mutex::Lock Object is not
*    adequate to you, you can use the Request and Release functions of the
*    Mutex object directly.
*  - It is permitted to destroy the critical section object while other
*    threads are waiting for the resource to become ready if all of these
*    threads check the return value of the Request function, even if they don't
*    use the timeout feature. This is guaranteed for the Mutex::Lock
*    class. Of course, other threads must not access the Mutex
*    Object after the error condition anymore.
*    You shoud be owner of the critical section when you use this feature to
*    ensure that no other thread is inside the critical section and tries
*    to release the resource afterwards.

*  Critical section class.
*
*  This is an OS/2 special. Thread switching is disabled for the current task
*  as long as at least an instance of this class exists.
*
*  Since it is by definition impossible to create instances from different
*  threads, this class can never cause deadlocks.
*
*  You should keep the lifetime of this class as low as possible, because
*  disabling the thread switching implicitely ignores the priority of the
*  other threads. So even real time threads may be stopped from a idle time
*  thread. And if a higher priority thread from another task interrupts the
*  low priority thread that holds the critical section class your application
*  gets completely stopped.
