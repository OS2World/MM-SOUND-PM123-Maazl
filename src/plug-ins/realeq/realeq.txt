Real Equalizer
==============

This Equalizer is a THE real thing.  A full fledged FIR designed with
the window method using RDFT and a Hamming window.  This
equalizer can also be used with any decoders contrarily to the MPEG
audio decoder!  Also since it's a real EQ, it uses juice. I mean major
juice.  Although, with MMX, the overhead is reduced A LOT. I'm planning
on using a Remez exchange algorithm instead of the window method to
optimize the FIR order needed to achieve the desired result.  All I know
is that it can "significantly reduce the order of a FIR filter", what
that exactly means, I don't know. I also don't have time to work on an
IIR based filter, MMX being pretty much the savior of FIR filters on the
Intel platform and because IIR filters dephase the sound (lower quality).

To come back on the filter order for the casual user, this is the number of
samples processed (in addition to the current sample) to obtain a new
sample. What does this means?  Ok say you are playing at 44100Hz, this
means there are 44100 samples passing per second in the filter also, right?
Ok, so say you'd like to catch 20Hz and filter that decently.  This means
you will need a filter order of at least 44100/20-1 = 2204!!!  With values
in this range, you can make your stereo EQ jealous.  Get a Pentium III
or Athlon and ditch your stereo.

This also means that with a small 64 coeficient filter order, the EQ
cannot process frequencies under 44100/(64+1) = ~678Hz properly. So the
choice of any bands under this frequency might be irrelevant, and
modifying one of the other might give the same effect (if any effect at
all).  The 32 middle octave bands are calculated by step of 1/3 octave as
defined by the ISO standard and are as follow in Hz:

16,0
20,0
25,0
31,5
40,0
50,0
63,0
80,0
100
125
160
200
250
315
400
500
630
800
1000
1250
1600
2000
2500
3150
4000
5000
6300
8000
10000
12500
16000
20000

The FIR order needs to be a multiple of 2 (or 16 because of MMX). The
plansize is for the initial FFT and therefore needs to be a power of 2.
Just leave it at 8192, that's fine, unless you are planning on playing
anything way over 48000kHz.

WARNING!! If you do not "Use MMX", the FPU will be used and you might
not be able to get away with 512 coeficients with the FPU.  So change it
to some more reasonable values such as 64 before trying it.

With MMX, it can play realtime with 768 coeficients on a P166 MMX and it
can easily do 4096 with a Celeron 500!!  This is pretty much as good as
most professional EQs...!!
