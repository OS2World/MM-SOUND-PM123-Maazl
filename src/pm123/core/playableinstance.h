/** @brief Instance of a PlayableRef within a laylist.
 *
 * Calling non-constant methods unsynchronized will not cause the application
 * to have undefined behavior. It will only cause the PlayableInstance to have a
 * non-deterministic but valid state.
 * The relationship of a PlayableInstance to it's parent container is weak.
 * That means that the PlayableInstance may be detached from the container before it dies.
 * A detached PlayableInstance will die as soon as it is no longer used. It may not be
 * reattached to a container.
 * That also means that there is no way to get a reference to the actual parent,
 * because once you got the reference it might immediately get invalid.
 * And to avoid this, the parent must be locked, which is impossible to ensure, of course.
 * All you can do is to verify whether the current PlayableInstance belongs to a given parent.
