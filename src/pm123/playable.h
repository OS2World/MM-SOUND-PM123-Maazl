/** @brief Instance of a PlayableRef within a laylist.
 *
 * Calling non-constant methods unsynchronized will not cause the application
 * to have undefined behavior. It will only cause the PlayableInstance to have a
 * non-deterministic but valid state.
 * The relationship of a PlayableInstance to it's parent container is weak.
 * That means that the PlayableInstance may be detached from the container before it dies.
 * A detached PlayableInstance will die as soon as it is no longer used. It may not be
 * reattached to a container.
 * That also means that there is no way to get a reference to the actual parent,
 * because once you got the reference it might immediately get invalid.
 * And to avoid this, the parent must be locked, which is impossible to ensure, of course.
 * All you can do is to verify whether the current PlayableInstance belongs to a given parent.

 * All instances of this class are owned by the class itself and must not be deleted.
 * You should only hold instances in the smart pointer \c int_ptr<Playable>. Otherwise
 * the referred object may be deleted in background. But it is allowed to call
 * a function with parameter \c Playable* (e.g. member functions) while you have an active
 * instance of \c int_ptr<Playable> unless the function keeps a local copy of the pointer
 * after it returns. It is also allowed to pass the result of a function returning
 * \c int_ptr<Playable> directly to a function taking \c Playable* with the same restriction
 * because temporary objects are always kept until the next statement.
 * If a function that receives \c Playable* wants to keep the reference after returning
 * it must create a \c int_ptr<Playable> object. This will work as expected.
