<h2>PM123's Known Problems &amp; Todo list</h2>
<table border="1" cellpadding="3" cellspacing="0">
<tbody>
<tr align="left" bgcolor="#cccccc">
<th>Attributes</th>
<th width="25%">Topic</th>
<th width="55%">Details</th>
</tr>
<tr class="open">
<td><strong>1 major todo, open</strong></td>
<td>Shuffle not working</td>
<td>There are some open issues how this should work with
respect to nested playlists and the previous/next buttons when the
playlist is modified.</td>
</tr>
<tr class="test">
<td><em>2 medium&nbsp;bug, testing</em></td>
<td>PM123 sometimes crashes when starting playback</td>
<td>Sometimes the decoder thread runs into a access
violation at start of playback.<br>
Reason unknown. Perhaps some threading issue.<br>
Seems to have gone.</td>
</tr>
<tr class="test">
<td>3 minor todo, untested</td>
<td>Handling of start and stop positions in nested playlists</td>
<td>There are several complications when start/stop
iterators of nested playlists have conflicting settings.</td>
</tr>
<tr class="fixed">
<td><em>4 medium&nbsp;bug, fixed</em></td>
<td>Messages about non-existing files at first start up</td>
<td>When starting the first error messages about
non-existing show up. This messages should be suppressed.</td>
</tr>
<tr class="open">
<td><em>5 medium bug, open</em></td>
<td>Decoder starts at wrong priority</td>
<td>In playlist mode when the data for the next song is
prefetched the new decoder thread does not inherit the priority from
the old thread. This may cause the playback to have drop outs.</td>
</tr>
<tr class="open">
<td><em>6 medium bug, open</em></td>
<td>Deadlocks with recursive playlists</td>
<td>With recursive playlist structures PM123 sometimes
deadlocks because the list semaphore are not requested top down. In
fact there is no top and no bottom in this case. Maybe implicitly
fixed by #10.</td>
</tr>
<tr class="open">
<td><em>7 medium todo, open</em></td>
<td>Invalid HTTP URLs take minutes</td>
<td>When an URL target is not available or invalid, it may
take several minutes for PM123 to notify this. If you have many of such
links e.g. in the bookmarks PM123 may be not responsive for a
considerable amount of time.<br>
This is a design problem, because any decoder plug-in might try to open
the URL without success, every time waiting for a timeout.</td>
</tr>
<tr class="test">
<td><strong>8 major bug, untested</strong></td>
<td>EAs lost when editing meta information</td>
<td>The 'Edit file info' feature of mpg123 and oggplay
destroys any EA information.</td>
</tr>
<tr class="open">
<td>9 minor todo, open</td>
<td>Code page handling of ID3 V1.x and ID3 V2.x tags</td>
<td>If the input and output code page is different the ID3
tags are not turn around stable. This causes special characters to be
destroyed when saving the tag.</td>
</tr>
<tr class="open">
<td><em>10 medium todo, open</em></td>
<td>PM lock-up when slider is used while a worker thread
gets information on a playlist.</td>
<td>Thread 1 acquires playlist mutex when slider is used.
Can cause SIQ locks. Maybe the Worker should not lock the entire
playlist while calculation of tech infos.</td>
</tr>
<tr class="open">
<td><em>11 medium bug, open</em></td>
<td>NavigateTo does not work if we see a slice of the
current root.</td>
<td>If the currently visible windows root is below the
currently loaded root, navigate to starts at the loaded root rather
than the window's root. This consequently fails.</td>
</tr>
<tr class="open">
<td><em>12 medium bug, open</em></td>
<td>Glitches of the slider when seeking or starting at a
certain location.</td>
<td>When playback starts at a non-zero starting point the
slider jumps to zero for the time of the initialization.</td>
</tr>
<tr class="open">
<td><em>13 medium todo, open</em></td>
<td>M3U8 support</td>
<td>PM123 1.32 also support Unicode playlist files. This
has to be ported.</td>
</tr>
<tr class="open">
<td>14 minor todo, open</td>
<td>Feature: continue playing when loading an enclosing
playlist.</td>
<td>If the currently playing item is part of the actually
loaded playlist, playing should not be aborted. This is a configuration
option.</td>
</tr>
<tr class="open">
<td>15 minor todo, open</td>
<td>playlist with alternative items for HTTP streams</td>
<td>For live streams&nbsp;it is quite common to provide
a playlist with a set of alternative streaming servers instead of a
single server. While PM123 is able to handle this kind of files and
play the first valid stream, it has unwanted effects when adding these
playlists to another playlist, because all of the contained items are
equivalent.</td>
