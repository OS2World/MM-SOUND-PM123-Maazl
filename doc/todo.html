  <td bgcolor=#FFFFCC>todo</td>
  <td bgcolor=#FFCCCC>major</td>
  <td>Shuffle not working</td>
  <td bgcolor=#FFCCCC>open</td>
  <td>There are some open issues how this should work with respect to
    nested playlists and the previous/next buttons when the playlist is modified.</td>
</tr><tr>
  <td bgcolor=#FFCCCC>fault</td>
  <td bgcolor=#FFFFCC>medium</td>
  <td>PM123 sometimes crashes when starting playback</td>
  <td bgcolor=#FFCCCC>open</td>
  <td>Sometimes the decoder thread runs into a access violation at start of playback.<br>
    Reason unknown. Perhaps some threading issue.</td>
</tr><tr>
  <td bgcolor=#FFFFCC>todo</td>
  <td bgcolor=#CCFFCC>minor</td>
  <td>Handling of start and stop positions in nested playlists</td>
  <td bgcolor=#FFFFCC>untested</td>
  <td>There are several complications when start/stop iterators of nested playlists have conflicting settings.</td>
</tr><tr>
  <td bgcolor=#FFCCCC>fault</td>
  <td bgcolor=#FFFFCC>medium</td>
  <td>Messages about non-existing files at first start up</td>
  <td bgcolor=#FFCCCC>open</td>
  <td>When starting the first error messages about non-existing show up.
    This messages should be supressed.</td>
</tr><tr>
  <td bgcolor=#FFCCCC>fault</td>
  <td bgcolor=#FFFFCC>medium</td>
  <td>Decoder starts at wrong priority</td>
  <td bgcolor=#FFCCCC>open</td>
  <td>In playlist mode when the data for the next song is prefetched
    the new decoder thread does not inherit the priority from the old thread.
    This may cause the playback to have drop outs.</td>
</tr><tr>
  <td bgcolor=#FFCCCC>fault</td>
  <td bgcolor=#FFFFCC>medium</td>
  <td>Deadlocks with recursive playlists</td>
  <td bgcolor=#FFCCCC>open</td>
  <td>With recursive playlist structures PM123 somtimes deadlocks
    because the list semaphore are not requested top down.
    In fact there is no top and no bottom in this case.</td>
</tr><tr>
  <td bgcolor=#FFFFCC>todo</td>
  <td bgcolor=#FFFFCC>medium</td>
  <td>Invalid HTTP URLs take minutes</td>
  <td bgcolor=#FFCCCC>open</td>
  <td>When an URL target is not available or invalid, it may take several minutes
    for PM123 to notify this.
    If you have many of such links e.g. in the bookmarks
    PM123 may be not responsive for a considerable amount of time.<br>
    This is a design problem, because any decoder plug-in might try
    to open the URL without success, everytime waiting for a timeout.</td>
</tr><tr>
  <td bgcolor=#FFCCCC>fault</td>
  <td bgcolor=#FFCCCC>major</td>
  <td>EAs lost when editing meta information</td>
  <td bgcolor=#FFFFCC>untested</td>
  <td>The 'Edit file info' feature of mpg123 and oggplay destroys any EA information.</td>
</tr><tr>
  <td bgcolor=#FFFFCC>todo</td>
  <td bgcolor=#CCFFCC>minor</td>
  <td>Codepage handling of ID3 V1.x and ID3 V2.x tags</td>
  <td bgcolor=#FFCCCC>open</td>
  <td>If the input and output codepage is different the ID3 tags are not turn around stable.
    This causes special characters to be destroyed when sving the tag.</td>
</tr><tr>
  <td bgcolor=#FFFFCC>todo</td>
  <td bgcolor=#FFFFCC>medium</td>
  <td>PM lock-up when slider is used while a worker thread gets information on a playlist.</td>
  <td bgcolor=#FFCCCC>open</td>
  <td>Thread 1 aquires playlist mutex when slider is used. Can cause SIQ locks.
    Maybe the Worker should not lock the entire playlist while calculation tech infos.</td>
