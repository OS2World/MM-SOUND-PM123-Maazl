<td>1</td>
<td bgcolor="#ffffcc">todo</td>
<td bgcolor="#ffcccc">major</td>
<td>Shuffle not working</td>
<td bgcolor="#ffcccc">open</td>
<td>There are some open issues how this should work with
respect to nested playlists and the previous/next buttons when the
playlist is modified.</td>

<td>2</td>
<td bgcolor="#ffcccc">fault</td>
<td bgcolor="#ffffcc">medium</td>
<td>PM123 sometimes crashes when starting playback</td>
<td bgcolor="#ffffcc">testing</td>
<td>Sometimes the decoder thread runs into a access
violation at start of playback.<br>
Reason unknown. Perhaps some threading issue.<br>
Seems to have gone.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>3</td>
<td bgcolor="#ffffcc">todo</td>
<td bgcolor="#ccffcc">minor</td>
<td>Handling of start and stop positions in nested playlists</td>
<td bgcolor="#ffffcc">untested</td>
<td>There are several complications when start/stop
iterators of nested playlists have conflicting settings.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>4</td>
<td bgcolor="#ffcccc">fault</td>
<td bgcolor="#ffffcc">medium</td>
<td>Messages about non-existing files at first start up</td>
<td bgcolor="#ccffcc">fixed</td>
<td>When starting the first error messages about
non-existing show up. This messages should be suppressed.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>5</td>
<td bgcolor="#ffcccc">fault</td>
<td bgcolor="#ffffcc">medium</td>
<td>Decoder starts at wrong priority</td>
<td bgcolor="#ffcccc">open</td>
<td>In playlist mode when the data for the next song is
prefetched the new decoder thread does not inherit the priority from
the old thread. This may cause the playback to have drop outs.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>6</td>
<td bgcolor="#ffcccc">fault</td>
<td bgcolor="#ffffcc">medium</td>
<td>Deadlocks with recursive playlists</td>
<td bgcolor="#ffcccc">open</td>
<td>With recursive playlist structures PM123 sometimes
deadlocks because the list semaphore are not requested top down. In
fact there is no top and no bottom in this case. Maybe implicitly
fixed by #10.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>7</td>
<td bgcolor="#ffffcc">todo</td>
<td bgcolor="#ffffcc">medium</td>
<td>Invalid HTTP URLs take minutes</td>
<td bgcolor="#ffcccc">open</td>
<td>When an URL target is not available or invalid, it may
take several minutes for PM123 to notify this. If you have many of such
links e.g. in the bookmarks PM123 may be not responsive for a
considerable amount of time.<br>
This is a design problem, because any decoder plug-in might try to open
the URL without success, every time waiting for a timeout.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>8</td>
<td bgcolor="#ffcccc">fault</td>
<td bgcolor="#ffcccc">major</td>
<td>EAs lost when editing meta information</td>
<td bgcolor="#ffffcc">untested</td>
<td>The 'Edit file info' feature of mpg123 and oggplay
destroys any EA information.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>9</td>
<td bgcolor="#ffffcc">todo</td>
<td bgcolor="#ccffcc">minor</td>
<td>Code page handling of ID3 V1.x and ID3 V2.x tags</td>
<td bgcolor="#ffcccc">open</td>
<td>If the input and output code page is different the ID3
tags are not turn around stable. This causes special characters to be
destroyed when saving the tag.</td>
</tr>

<td bgcolor="#ffffcc">todo</td>
<td bgcolor="#ffffcc">medium</td>
<td>PM lock-up when slider is used while a worker thread
gets information on a playlist.</td>
<td bgcolor="#ffcccc">open</td>
<td>Thread 1 acquires playlist mutex when slider is used.
Can cause SIQ locks. Maybe the Worker should not lock the entire
playlist while calculation of tech infos.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>11</td>
<td bgcolor="#ffcccc">fault</td>
<td bgcolor="#ffffcc">medium</td>
<td>NavigateTo does not work if we see a slice of the
current root.</td>
<td bgcolor="#ffcccc">open</td>
<td>If the currently visible windows root is below the
currently loaded root, navigate to starts at the loaded root rather
than the window's root. This consequently fails.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>12</td>
<td bgcolor="#ffcccc">fault</td>
<td bgcolor="#ccffcc">minor</td>
<td>Glitches of the slider when seeking or starting at a
certain location.</td>
<td bgcolor="#ffcccc">open</td>
<td>When playback starts at a non-zero starting point the
slider jumps to zero for the time of the initialization.</td>
