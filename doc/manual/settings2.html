<h3>User interface</h3>
<dl>
  <dt><b>Dock windows to <var>x</var> pixels</b>
  <dd>This will allow the windows to dock into the main player window so that when
  then main window is moved, the docked window follows. Specify the distance in
  pixels to allow for docking.
</dl>

<h3>Remote control</h3>
<dl>
  <dt><b>Pipe name</b>
  <dd>Specify the name of the named pipe that is used to control PM123 remotely.
    Only one instance of PM123 can listen at a certain pipe name.
    If you want to control different instances remotely at the same time
    they mus use different pipe names and therefore different configuration files.

<dt><b>Buffer size</b>
