<b><font size=+2>Welcome to PM123!</font></b>
<p>
Hello and welcome to the wonderful world of digital music on OS/2. First
we must congratulate you for choosing the best MPEG-audio player
available for OS/2! PM123 has been in development since beginning of
1997 and has become the most advanced player on OS/2.
<p>
PM123 is mainly a native OS/2 PM application for playing audio MPEG
1.0, 2.0 and 2.5 Layer I, II, and III. It does so by using mpg123
engine, which is still quite fast. The interface, however, is a whole
new world.
