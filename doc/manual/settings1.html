<h2>PM123's General Behavior Settings</h2>
<blockquote> <img src="images/prop1.png">
</blockquote>
<h3>Behavior</h3>
<dl>
  <dt><b>Start playing on file load</b> </dt>
  <dd>Automatically starts playing when you load a file or playlist. </dd>
  <dt><b>Retain playing position</b> </dt>
  <dd>You may keep the current playing position when you <b>exit PM123</b>
while playing and/or when you press the <b>stop button</b>. The two
options cause PM123 to continue playing at exactly the location where
it stopped.<br>
    <u>Note:</u> If you click "Retain playing position on stop", the
only way to start over from the beginning is to drag the slider to the
start or to change the current song. </dd>
</dl>
<h3>Navigation</h3>
<dl>
  <dt><b><a name="alt_slider"></a>Alternate slider</b> <img
 src="images/altslider.bmp" align="bottom"> </dt>
  <dd>Alternate navigation is available in playlist mode to navigate
directly through the entire playlist. It is activated by pressing the
Alt key while the main window has the focus. You can choose between
three types of behavior:
    <ul>
      <li><b>Song only</b><br>
This allows you to use the slider to jump to the <em>beginning</em> of
an arbitrary song within a playlist. </li>
      <li><b>Song &amp; time</b><br>
This option will map all songs in the playlist to equidistant slices of
the slider. Within this blocks you can navigate to an relative location
within the song item (if it has finite length). </li>
      <li><b>Time only</b><br>
This will navigate within the currently loaded playlist at a linear
time scale as if it were one very long song. If the total playing time
of the playlist is unknown (e.g. because a radio stream is part of the
it) alternate navigation will fall back to "Song &amp; time". </li>
    </ul>
  </dd>
</dl>
