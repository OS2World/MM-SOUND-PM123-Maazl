<h2>PM123's Configuration Settings 1/2</h2>

<h3>Behaviour</h3>
<dl>
  <dt><b>Start playing on file load</b>
  <dd>Automatically starts playing when you load a file or playlist.
  <dt><b>Trash buffers on fast forward/rewind</b>
  <dd>This option provides a much faster response on fast forward and rewind, but consumes more CPU time.
  <dt><b>Retain playling position</b>
  <dd>You may keep the current playing position when you exit PM123 while playing and/or when you press the stop button.
    The two options cause PM123 to continue playing at exactly the location where it stopped.
    If you click "Retain playling position on stop", the only way to start over from the beginning
    is to drag the slider to the start or to change the current song.
</dl>

<h3>Navigation</h3>
<dl>
  <dt><b>Alternate navigation</b>
  <dd>Alternate navigation is available in playlist mode to navigate directly through the entire playlist.
    It is activated by pressing the Alt key while the main window has the focus.
    You can choose between three types of behaviour:
    <ul>
      <li><b>Song only</b><br>
        This allows you to use the slider to jump to the <em>beginning</em>
        of an arbitrary song within a playlist.
      <li><b>Song & time</b><br>
        This option will map all songs in the playlist to equidistant slices of the slider.
        Within this block you can navigate to an absolute location within the song item
        (if it has finite length).
      <li><b>Time only</b><br>
        This will navigate within the currently loaded playlist at a linear time scale
        as if it were one very long song. If the total playing time of the playlist
        is unknown (e.g. because a radio stream is part of the it)
        alternate navigation will behave the same as with option "Song & time". 
    </ul>
</dl>

<h3>Playlists</h3>
<dl>
  <dt><b>Auto 'play' on 'use playlist'</b>
  <dd>Automatically starts playing when a playlist is loaded ("Use playlist").
  <dt><b>Auto 'use playlist' on add</b>
  <dd>Automatically loads a playlist if items are appended to it.
  <dt><b>Recurse into subdirectories at drag & drop by default</b>
  <dd>When you drop a folder to PM123 it will be added as a virtual playlist
    that also contains the subfolders as vitual playlists.
  <dt><b>Append to default playlist</b>
  <dd>When you drop items to PM123 or call PM123 with a filename in the command line
    (most likely by a association of the PMSHELL) you may append these items to the default
    playlist instead of immediately replacing the currently playing file with the new song.
    This may be used to enqueue songs.
  <dt><b>Queue mode</b>
  <dd>In queue mode PM123 removes completely played items from the default playlist.
    Together with "Append to default playlist" this offers an option to use the default
    playlist as queue of items to play. This is similar to a printer queue.
