<b><font size=+2>PM123's ID3 Tag Editor</font></b>

<p><i>ID3 tag editor? What's that?</i>, you might ask. ID3 tags are way
of appending some information to each MP3 file. The information contains
song title, artist's name, album's name, music's style, release year and
a comment. ID3 tags don't belong to the MPEG standard, but it has already
become a widely spread standard among MP3 listeners. It's a good idea to
add this tag to your MP3 files (if your filenames get mangled, you'll always
know the songname).

PM123's tag editor is quite simpled. It can be invoked for the current
file from the <a href="mainmenu.html">main menu</a> or by pressing <b>Ctrl+E</b>
on the player window. You can also edit the tags of the files in the playlist
by right clicking a file in the playlist and selecting <b>Edit Tag</b>
or by pressing <b>Ctrl+E</b> in the playlist. You can also remove a tag
by selecting <b>Delete Tag</b>.
