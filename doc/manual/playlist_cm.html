  <dt><b>Load this playlist</b> / <b>Load all</b>
  <dd><p>Load the entire playlist into the player. This will stop any other playback if any.
  <dt><b>Show detailed view</b>
  <dd><p>Opens the current topmost playlist in the <a href="playlist.html">playlist editor</a>.
  <dt><b>Show tree view</b>

  <dt><b>Show content info</b>

  <dt><b>Append...</b>
  <dd><p><img SRC="images/listmenu_append.gif"><br>
    Appends one or multiple files, an URL from the Internet for streaming or
    CD tracks to the current playlist.
  <dt><b>Sort</b>
  <dd><p>This submenu has options to sort the playlist by size, playing time, filename or songname and so on.
  <dt><b>Clear</b>
  <dd><p>Clear the whole list.<br>
    This does not immediately modify or delete the file on disk.
  <dt><b>Reload</b>
  <dd><p>Reload the list from the disk file or refresh the folder content.<br>
    If the list in memory is modified you are prompted to commit the reload.
  <dt><b>Open another...</b>
  <dd>Opens another playlist. This does not close the current window but creates a new window.
    However, you cannot open two windows of the same playlist and the same view (tree or detailed).
    In this case the existing window is only shown.<br>
    The view type of the new window is the same as the view type of the current window.
  <dt><b>Save...</b>
  <dd>Saves the current playlist.<br>
    If the list is a folder you can only save under a different name.
    Saving to another file does not change the title of the crrent window.
    This is compareable to 'Save copy as...' of other applications.
