<b><font size=+2>PM123's Sound Visualization Plug-in</font></b>
<p>PM123 comes with a sound visualization plugin, <tt>ANALYZER.DLL</tt>
which is located in the visplug directory. The plugin is visible right
next to the volume bar. By default it shows the spectrum analyzer. Click
it once to bring up the spectrum bars, a second time to bring up the oscilloscope
and third time to disable it.

<p>Note that because the spectrum analyzer is <i>visual plugin</i> and it
is <i>skin specific</i> and will not display on older PM123 skins. But
you can add them easily to any skin by editing the skin's <tt>.SKN</tt>
file and adding this to it:
<pre>1=visplug/analyzer.dll,x,y,size-x,size-y</pre>
<p>Replace <tt>x, y, size-x</tt> and <tt>size-y</tt> with suitable coordinates
(a easy way to find out the coordinates for a certain area is to load up
<a href="http://www.pmview.com">PMView</a>, take a Window capture of the skin and
use the 'Track info' feature). You can also use
<a href="http://www.winamp.com">WinAmp</a>-compatible <tt>viscolor.txt</tt>
files like this:
<pre>1=visplug/analyzer.dll,x,y,size-x,size-y,viscolor.txt</pre>
<p>The plugin will then read <tt>viscolor.txt</tt> and adapt to colors specified
in it! This text file contains all the 24 colours that will be shown in the
visualization area when it is active (oscilloscope or spectrum analyzer).
<p>Each colour is defined by three decimal numbers (red, green and blue components)
separated by a comma, everything between "//" and the end of a line is a comment,
it won't be taken into account. Each component range between 0 (no colour, black)
to 255 (full colour: red, green or blue), so 0,0,0 is black, 255,255,255 is white.
The order of the colours is defined in the followed table: the fist two colours
define the background and dots (check it to see what are the dots), the next 16
colours are the analyzer's colours from top to bottom, the next 5 colours are
the oscilloscope's ones, from center to top/bottom, the last colour is for the
analyzer's peak markers.
