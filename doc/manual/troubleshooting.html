<h2>PM123's Troubleshooting</h2>
<ol>
<li><h4>The player says that no matching decoder plug-in is available
  when playing files without standard extensions.</h4>
  <p>By default PM123 tries decoders only if either the file extension is known to work
  with this decoder or the file type is listed in the file type list of the matching
  decoder plug-in in the <a href="plug-ins_dec-cfg.html">configuration dialog</a>. 
  </p><ul>
    <li>Either add one of the file types that the file has in the file's properties
    dialog to the list of known types for the matching decode plug-in or
    </li><li>check the box 'Try unsupported file extensions and types too'
    for the desired plug-in.
  </li></ul></li>
<li><h4>The player skips and/or the audio doesn't sound right!</h4>
  <p>There might be multiple reasons if you encounter this problem.
  Some of them are listed here. First of all, <b>check your MP3 file</b>.
  It may be broken. It might play successfully on another player, but mpg123
  may not necessarily like it. If you think it's not related to the input
  stream, maybe the problem is one of these:
  </p><ul>
    <li>You have a polling device driver (for example, a very old 2x CD-ROM or <tt>PRINT01.SYS</tt>
    without <tt>/IRQ</tt> switch)</li>
    <li>Bad CD-ROMs tend to seek the disk often. This usually takes 100% CPU and
    halts I/O operation until the drive completes the seek. You can try cleaning
    the CD.</li>
    <li>You have a video card that supports "<i>automatic PCI bus retry</i>", but
    your motherboard stops processing during those retries. Disable the feature
    (video driver).</li>
    <li>You have an ATI Mach64 and you are experiencing a bug in the video driver
    using software mouse pointers (i.e. colored mouse pointers).</li>
    <li>You have a process that hogs all the CPU. Get a CPU monitor (we recommend
    CPUMon) and a process killer from <tt><a href="http://hobbes.nmsu.edu">hobbes.nmsu.edu</a></tt>.</li>
    <li>You have Full Window Drag enabled. It sucks 100% CPU power when you use
    it. On Warp 4, disable it from System / User Interface / Window Manipulation / Full Window Dragging.</li>
    <li>Your CPU is too slow (or overheated). We recommend you have at least a
    Pentium machine.</li>
    <li>You have outdated, old or <b>buggy sound drivers</b>. This is a common
    problem. Many sound drivers out there for OS/2 just plain suck. We have
    tried to test PM123 on as many drivers as we can, but some drivers are
    incomplete and/or buggy.</li>
    <li>You have a very old or just generally bad motherboard, video card or IO
    controller card. This is a rare problem, though.</li>
  </ul></li>
<li><h4>The player crashes on startup.</h4>
  <ul>
    <li>You have an old <tt>MPG123.DLL</tt> (or some other DLL PM123 comes with)
    in your <tt>LIBPATH</tt>.
    Or you tried to start different versions of PM123 from different directories
    at the same time.<br>
    Set <tt>LIBPATHSTRICT=T</tt> to get this working. (Requires recent kernel.)</li>
    <li>Your system doesn't support DIVE (Direct Video Extensions). Try renaming
    <tt>visplug\analyzer.dll</tt> to something else.</li>
    <li>Something is very wrong....</li>
  </ul></li>
<li><h4>My mouse cursor is jerky or jumpy!</h4>
  <ul>
    <li>You have a bad video driver. You should try
    <a href="http://www.scitechsoft.com/sdd_os2.html">SciTech Display
    Drivers</a> which should fix all your problems. If this does
    not work out, we cannot help you more on this matter, but we urge you to
    call/mail your video driver manufacturer about this problem.
    </li><li>You have a colored or animated mouse pointer that is not supported
    properly by your video driver. They are <b>software mouse cursors</b>
    and they don't mix very well with high performance multimedia
    applications that draw rapidly to the screen.  SDD drivers do not
    exhibit this problem.  Switch back to the old black and white OS/2
    default mouse pointer and/or disable pointer animation. The default b/w
    pointer is a <b>hardware mouse cursor</b>. This problem is often caused
    by all high speed DIVE applications.
    </li><li>If all fails, one way to fix this problem is to set analyzer disabled by
    default (Properties -&gt; Plug-Ins -&gt; analyzer.dll -&gt; Configure). Of
    course you won't see the cool graphics then.
  </li></ul></li>
<li><h4>The analyzer and the timers stop woring after long playbacks.</h4>
  <p>This is a bug in some sound drivers that prevents MMOS2
    to return playing times beyond 2**<sup>30</sup> samples.
    This is after about 6 to 7 hours at 44 to 48 kHz sampling rate.<br>
    If you activated 'retain playing position on stop' press the play/stop
    button twice and the sound device is reinitialized. This gives you another 6 hours.</p>
