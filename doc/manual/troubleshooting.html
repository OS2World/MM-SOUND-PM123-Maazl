<b><font size=+2>PM123's Troubleshooting</font></b>
<p>
<b>1. The player skips and/or the audio doesn't sound right!</b>
<blockquote>
There might be multiple reasons if you encounter this problem.
Some of them are listed here. First of all, <b>check your MP3 file</b>.
It may be broken. It might play succesfully on another player, but mpg123
may not necessarily like it. If you think it's not related to the input
stream, maybe the problem is one of these:
<ul>
<li>You have a polling device driver (for example, a very old 2x CD-ROM or <tt>PRINT01.SYS</tt>
without <tt>/IRQ</tt> switch)</li>
<li>Bad CD-ROMs tend to seek the disk often. This usually takes 100% CPU and
halts I/O operation until the drive completes the seek. You can try cleaning
the CD.</li>
<li>You have a video card that supports "<i>automatic PCI bus retry</i>", but
your motherboard stops processing during those retries. Disable the feature
(video driver).</li>
<li>You have an ATI Mach64 and you are experiencing a bug in the video driver
using software mouse pointers (ie. colored mouse pointers).</li>
<li>You have a process that hogs all the CPU. Get a CPU monitor (we recommend
CPUMon) and a process killer from <tt><a href="http://hobbes.nmsu.edu">hobbes.nmsu.edu</a></tt>.</li>
<li>You have Full Window Drag enabled. It sucks 100% CPU power when you use
it. On Warp 4, disable it from System / User Interface / Window Manipulation / Full Window Dragging.</li>
<li>Your CPU is too slow (or overheated). We recommend you have at least a
Pentium machine.</li>
<li>You have outdated, old or <b>buggy sound drivers</b>. This is a common
problem. Many sound drivers out there for OS/2 just plain suck. We have
tried to test PM123 on as many drivers as we can, but some drivers are
incomplete and/or buggy.</li>
<li>You have a very old or just generally bad motherboard, video card or IO
controller card. This is a rare problem, though.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<b>2. The player crashes on startup.</b>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>You have an old <tt>MPG123.DLL</tt> (or some other DLL PM123 comes with)
in your <tt>LIBPATH</tt>.</li>
<li>Your system doesn't support DIVE (Direct Video Extensions). Try renaming
<tt>visplug\analyzer.dll</tt>
to something else.</li>
<li>Something is very wrong...</a>.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<b>3. My mouse cursor is jerky or jumpy!</b>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>You have a bad video driver. You should try
<a href="http://www.scitechsoft.com/sdd_os2.html">Scitech Display
Drivers</a> which should fix all your problems. If this does
not work out, we cannot help you more on this matter, but we urge you to
call/mail your video driver manufacturer about this problem.
<li>You have a colored or animated mouse pointer that is not supported
properly by your video driver. They are <b>software mouse cursors</b>
and they don't mix very well with high performance multimedia
applications that draw rapidly to the screen.  SDD drivers do not
exhibit this problem.  Switch back to the old black and white OS/2
default mouse pointer and/or disable pointer animation. The default b/w
pointer is a <b>hardware mouse cursor</b>. This problem is often caused
by all high speed DIVE applications.
<li>If all fails, one way to fix this problem is to set analyzer disabled by
default (Properties -> Plug-Ins -> analyzer.dll -> Configure). Of
course you won't see the cool graphics then.
</ul>
