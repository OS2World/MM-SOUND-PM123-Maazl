</head>
<body>
<h2>PM123 playlist location strings</h2>
<p>PM123 uses a special notation to store playing positions. These strings are used at
<ul>
  <li>the start and stop positions of playlist items or bookmarks and
  <li>the navigate command of the PM123 remote interface.
</ul>
<p>A location string defines an exact point inside a playlist and song.
  In case of playlists it can consist of several parts separated by '<tt>;</tt>'
  or new-line if the new-line character is allowed.
  The parts may be enclosed with double quotes ('<tt>"</tt>') to avoid confusion with special characters.
<p>The first part is the item in the playlist.
  The last part is the playing position in the song.
  If the playlist is deep additional parts in between define the items in the nested playlist structure.
<p>A location string may be incomplete in the way that it does not provide a time offset in the song
  or it does not navigate to the deepmost level of a tree of nested playlists. 
<h4>Example:</h4>
<blockquote>
<pre>my_nested_playlist.lst
my_favorite_song.mp3[2]
3:44</pre>
</blockquote>
or
<blockquote>
<pre>my_nested_playlist.lst;"my_favorite_song.mp3"[2];3:44</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>The first part navigates to the first occurrency of the file <tt>my_nested_playlist.lst</tt> in the current playlist.<br>
The second part navigates to the second occurrency of <tt>my_favorite_song.mp3</tt> in my_nested_playlist.lst.
It is enclosed with quotes. In this case this is optional because the relative URL contains neither a semicolon nor square brackets at the end.<br>
The last part navigates to the offset 3:44 within <tt>my_favorite_song.mp3</tt>.
<blockquote>
<pre>my_playlist.lst
 +- my_favorite_song.mp3 <a href="#note1"><sup>(1)</sup></a>
 +- another_song.mp3
 <font color=red>+- my_nested_playlist.lst</font>
     +- my_favorite_song.mp3 <a href="#note2"><sup>(2)</sup></a>
     +- my_playlist.lst <a href="#note3"><sup>(3)</sup></a>
     +- another_song.mp3
     <font color=red>+- my_favorite_song.mp3</font>
        <font color=red>Offset: 3:44</font>
     +- song_#3.mp3
     +- my_favorite_song.mp3
 +- song_#4.mp3
 +- another_nested playlist.lst</pre>
</blockquote>
Notes:
<ol>
  <li><a name="note1"></a>While this song is part of the location string it is not adressed
    because the navigation goes into the nested playlist <tt>my_nested_playlist.lst</tt> first.
  <li><a name="note2"></a>This item is skipped because the indexer <tt>[2]</tt> searches for the second location of this song.
  <li><a name="note3"></a>This recursive entry is skipped anyway.
</ol> 

<h3>Playlist location syntax</h3>
<p>To locate a playlist item use one of the following syntax variants:
<ul>
  <li><strong><tt><var>relative URL</var></tt> or<br>
    <tt><var>absolute URL</var></tt></strong><br>
    Navigates to the first occurency of the above <tt><var>URL</var></tt> within the playlist.<br>
    The path is considered to be relativ within the context of the immediately enclosing playlist.
    The use of '<tt>../</tt>' is allowed.
  <li><strong><tt><var>relative URL</var>[<var>index</var>]</tt> or<br>
    <tt><var>absolute URL</var>[<var>index</var>]</tt></strong><br>
    Navigates to the occurency #<tt><var>index</var></tt> of <tt><var>URL</var></tt> within the playlist.
  <li><strong><tt>[<var>index</var>]</tt></strong><br>
    Navigates to item #<tt><var>index</var></tt> within the playlist.
    It is not recommended to use this method because it easily may fail the goal when the list is modified.<br>
    Note that the numbering differs from the item numbers displayed in the PM123 window,
    because only the top-level items in the playlist count here.
  <li><strong><tt>..</tt></strong><br>
    Navigate one level up. This makes only sense if we do not start from the top level.
</ul>
<p>It is an error to
<ul>
  <li>navigate to a non-existing item,
  <li>enclose <tt><var>index</var></tt> with quotes,
  <li>navigate into a recursive item (see <a href="#note3">note 3</a>).
</ul>
<p>If relative navigation is used remember that the current location is always a song.
  So you need at least one '<tt>..;</tt>' to get to the deepmost playlist.

<h3>Song location syntax</h3>
If the current item is a song you may only specify a time offset from the beginning. Syntax:
<ul>
  <li><strong><tt><var>seconds</var></tt></strong><br>
  <li><strong><tt><var>seconds</var>.<var>fractionals</var></tt></strong><br>
  <li><strong><tt><var>minutes</var>:<var>seconds</var></tt></strong><br>
  <li><strong><tt><var>minutes</var>:<var>seconds</var>.<var>fractionals</var></tt></strong><br>
  <li><strong><tt><var>hours</var>:<var>minutes</var>:<var>seconds</var></tt></strong><br>
  <li><strong><tt><var>hours</var>:<var>minutes</var>:<var>seconds</var>.<var>fractionals</var></tt></strong><br>
  <li><strong><tt><var>days</var>:<var>hours</var>:<var>minutes</var>:<var>seconds</var></tt></strong><br>
  <li><strong><tt><var>days</var>:<var>hours</var>:<var>minutes</var>:<var>seconds</var>.<var>fractionals</var></tt></strong><br>
</ul>
<p>It is valid to specify offsets larger the one minute as seconds and so on.<br>
  Using a sufficient number of fractional digits it is possible to address locations with an accouracy of one sample.
  However, some decoder plug-ins may bend it.
