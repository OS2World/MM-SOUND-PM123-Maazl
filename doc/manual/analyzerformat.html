<h2>PM123's Sound Visualization color cofiguration file</h2>
<p>The <a href="analyzer.html">Analyzer plug-in</a> will read a text file
with color configurations if the <a href="sguide.html">skin configuration file</a> contains its name in
the <tt>1=visplug/analyzer.dll</tt>... line.</p>
<p>This text file contains all the colours that will be shown in
the visualization area when it is active (oscilloscope, spectrum or spectroscope
analyzer).</p>
<p>Each color is defined by three decimal numbers (red, green
and blue components)
separated by a comma, everything between "//" and the end of a line is
a comment,
it won't be taken into account. Each component range between 0 (no
colour, black)
to 255 (full colour: red, green or blue), so 0,0,0 is black,
255,255,255 is white.
The order of the colours is defined in the followed table: the fist two
colours
define the background and dots (check it to see what are the dots), the
next 16
colours are the analyzer's colours from top to bottom, the next 5
colours are
the oscilloscope's ones, from center to top/bottom, the last colour is
for the
analyzer's peak markers.

<p>Since <strong>version 2.10</strong> of&nbsp;<tt>ANALYZER.DLL</tt>
the coloring file may also have the following, new format:</p>
<blockquote>
<pre>// ANALYZER 21 (this comment line is required at the top!)
// This file represents the default values
// general colors ...
BACKGROUND=0,0,0
DOTS=0,90,0
PEAK=0,255,0
// oscilloscope colors [0..4] ...
OSCILLOSCOPE-0=0,180,0
OSCILLOSCOPE-3=0,255,0
// spectrum analyzer colors [0..30] ...
ANALYZER-0=255,0,0
ANALYZER-100%=0,255,0
// spectroscope colors [0..63] ...
SPECTROSCOPE-0=0,0,0
SPECTROSCOPE-8=0,0,32
SPECTROSCOPE-16=128,0,0
SPECTROSCOPE-24=255,0,0
SPECTROSCOPE-40=255,255,0
SPECTROSCOPE-55=128,255,255
SPECTROSCOPE-63=255,255,255</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>The color ranges <tt>OSCILLOSCOPE</tt> and <tt>SPECTRUM</tt> need not
to be fully defined. The missing values are interpolated
automatically. But keep in mind that the interpolation is done in YDbDr
color space in cylindrical coordinates. The color index may be specified
relative when followed by a <tt>%</tt> sign. Fractional numbers are allowed.</p>
<p>The range <tt>OSCILLOSCOPE-0</tt> to <tt>OSCILLOSCOPE-4</tt>
maps to line 19 to 23 in the old WinAmp-compatible file format. The
range <tt>ANALYZER-24</tt> to <tt>ANALYZER-55</tt>
is equivalent to line 18 to 3 (in reverse order) in the old
format. Now there are 31 colors instead of 16 colors. The range <tt>SPECTRUM-0</tt>
to <tt>SPECTRUM-63</tt> is new and used for the spectroscope display.</p>
<p>When loading a <tt>viscolor.txt</tt> file in the old
format the interpolation is also used to get the colors in the new
format. The new color range <tt>SPECTRUM-0</tt>
to <tt>SPECTRUM-63</tt>
is created by interpolating between line 0 (background) to line 18
(analyzer bottom) following the analyzer colors to line 3 (analyzer
top) and then to line 24
(analyzer peak). This is currently the only use of line 24. </p>
