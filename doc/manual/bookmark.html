<h2>PM123's Bookmarks</h2>
<p>PM123 uses a special playlist called <tt>bookmark.lst</tt> in the PM123 folder
  to store the user's bookmarks. The bookmarks are automatically saved on exit.
  This bookmarks are shown in the <a href="mainmenu.html">context menu</a> of the player.
  Changes to this playlist are immediately reflected to the context menu.

<h3>Manage bookmarks</h3>
<ul>
  <li> Either choose one of the 'Add bookmark' entries from the players <a href="mainmenu.html">context menu</a> or
  <li>open the bookmark editor by choosing 'Edit Bookmarks...' from the players context menu
    and use the <a href="playlist.html">playlist manipulation functions</a> to organize your bookmarks.
</ul>

<h3>Bookmark folders</h3>
<p>If you add a <strong>nested playlists</strong> to the bookmark list
  this causes a <strong>submenu</strong> in the bookmarks.
  This can be useful to structure your bookmarks.
<p>Note that every nested playlist in the bookmarks folder have to be a <strong>seperate file</strong>.
  You must give them a unique filename.<br>
  You may place this files in the PM123 folder or somewhere else.
  But you should ensure that the files are reachable when PM123 starts up.
  Otherwise the associated submenus will be disabled.
<p>If you bookmark a recursive link to a <a href="folderlist.html">filesystem folder</a>
  PM123 will browse online through your filesystem.
  However, this may eat a reasonable amount of ressources. So be careful.
<p>If you want to <strong>bookmark an entire playlist</strong> simply add it somewhere to your bookmarks.
  When you want to load this playlist do not open the conditional cascade submenu
  but click the list directly instead. This will cause PM123 to load a playlist
  instead of a single song.
<p>To add a <strong>new folder</strong> choose 'Add' from the <a href="playlist_cm.html">context menu</a>
  and add a non existent playlist file. This will give an error the first time, but it is added anyway.
  Once you added the playlist, you may add items to it e.g. by <a href="dragndrop.html">Drag and Drop</a>.<br>
  <em>Don't forget to save the playlist, because only the top level bookmark list is saved automatically.</em>
