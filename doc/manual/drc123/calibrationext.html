    <h2>Extended calibration options </h2>
    <p><img alt="" src="images/calibrateext.png" height="684" width="739"><strong></strong></p>
    <p><em>Normally there is no need to adjust the extended settings.</em>
      However, if you know what you are doing you might improve some things
      here.</p>
    <h3>General Parameters</h3>
    <dl>
      <dt><b>FFT size/cycle length</b></dt>
      <dd>Number of samples used for frequency analysis by FFT. Therefore it
        must be a power of two.</dd>
      <dd>This is also the number of samples after that the reference signal
        repeats itself. This implies that all frequencies used for measurement
        are multiples of the <i>cycle time</i> = <i>cycle length</i> / <i>sampling
          rate</i>.<br>
        The parameter mainly controls how long your measurement will take.</dd>
      <dt><b>Discard first cycles</b></dt>
      <dd>After pressing Start the first n samples of the test recording are
        discarded. This is required to give the components a chance to reach a
        steady state. It is also useful to skip glitches at the start of the
        recording. Recommended values are in the order of one or two cycle
        times.</dd>
      <dt><b>Frequency bin factor </b></dt>
      <dd>Join neighbor frequencies in the result file if they fit into an
        interval [<var>f</var>,<var>f</var>*(1+<var>binfactor</var>)]. The gain
        and the group delay will be averaged for all frequencies in the bin.</dd>
      <dt><b>Frequency range</b></dt>
      <dd>This is the range of frequencies that is used for the measurement.
        Outside this interval the test signal contains no energy.<br>
        This also controls the X axis of the <a href="graphs.html">graphs</a>.</dd>
    </dl>
    <h3>Display settings</h3>
    <dl>
      <dt><b>Frequency response gain</b></dt>
      <dd>Range of the left Y axis of the frequency response graph.</dd>
      <dt><b>Frequency response delay</b></dt>
      <dd>Range of the right Y axis of the frequency response graph.<br>
        The units are degrees, i.e. 1/360 cycles at the particular frequency.</dd>
      <dt><b>Cross talk/IM gain</b></dt>
      <dd>Range of the Y axis of the cross talk/intermodulation graph.</dd>
      <dt><b>Record level indicator range</b></dt>
      <dd>Set the level of the left boundary of the record level indicators.</dd>
      <dt><b>Record level indicator limits</b></dt>
      <dd>Levels where the color of the record level indicator turns from green
        to yellow and red respectively.</dd>
    </dl>
    <h3>Reference signal</h3>
    <dl>
      <dt><b>Energy distribution exponent</b></dt>
      <dd>This is the weight exponent used for the relative intensity of
        different frequencies.<br>
        <var>I</var> ~ <var>f<sup><small>exponent</small></sup></var><br>
        Reasonable values are in the range [-0.5, 0]<sup><var></var></sup><var></var>.</dd>
      <dt><b>Minimum factor to next frequency</b></dt>
      <dd>To limit the phase noise it could be helpful to set this factor to a
        value slightly larger than 1. This causes the energy of frequencies
        closer than the given factor to be collected in bins with are at least
        this factor away. But remember that this also decreases the maximum
        group delay at higher frequencies.</dd>
      <dt><b>Line frequency notch</b></dt>
      <dd>Although good equipment will not be sensitive in practice often the
        power line frequency and its harmonics appear as noise. Selecting a
        nonzero value will eliminate the line frequency and the selected number
        of harmonics from the measurement. Selecting 1 removes only the line
        frequency itself, 2 removes also the double line frequency and so on.<br>
        The drawback is that high group delays cannot longer be handled
        correctly around the line frequency.<br>
        Reasonable values are 0 if you do not need this work around and 3 to
        remove up to the 3<small><sup>rd</sup></small> harmonic. Of course, you
        need to setup the line frequency of your country correctly for this to
        work. Usually 50 or 60 Hz.</dd>
      <dt><b>Use only odd frequencies in spectrum</b></dt>
      <dd>If this option is checked all frequencies that fit an even number of
        times in the cycle time are not used. This causes second order
        intermodulations, i.e. sums and differences of other frequencies, always
        to appear at even frequencies that do not contribute to the result.<br>
        Disabling this option also disables the IM graphs in calibration.</dd>
      <dt><b>Skip some frequencies in stereo mode</b></dt>
      <dd>When entering stereo mode every second frequency is used for each
        channel. This introduces a unwanted symmetry into the autocorrelation
        function of the test signal. When this option is enabled some randomly
        chosen frequencies in the spectrum are eliminated. This breaks the
        symmetry and enables the measurement to deal with twice as large delays
        - the same as in single channel mode.</dd>
