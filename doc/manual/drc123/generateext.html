    <h2>Filter generation options </h2>
    <p><img src="images/generateext.png"></p>
    <h3>General settings</h3>
    <dl>
      <dt><b>Frequency range</b></dt>
      <dd>This is the range of frequencies where a flat room response is
        intended. <em>Do not extend the range far beyond the capabilities of
          your speakers.</em> Especially speakers with vented enclosures dislike
        lower frequencies and may be destroyed this way.<br>
        This also controls the X axis of the <a href="graphs.html">graphs</a>.</dd>
      <dt><b>Frequency bin size</b></dt>
      <dd>The resulting filter kernel is an interpolating function rather than
        exact values. The next frequency is calculated by adding a constant and
        a relative factor to the current frequency.<br>
        There is normally no need to change this option.</dd>
      <dt><b>Do not process phase response</b></dt>
      <dd>This is mainly a work around for insufficiently accurate measurements.
        If you turn on this option then the resulting filter will not compensate
        for the group delay but only for the frequency response. This results in
        a symmetric, linear phase filter. Note that this is a significant
        cutback. You will not get the crisp results than from a full
        compensation.</dd>
    </dl>
    <h3>Normalization settings</h3>
    <p>DRC123 must normalize the different measurements to a common level before
      combining them. This is done by calculating an average gain and an average
      group delay.</p>
    <dl>
      <dt><b>Frequency range</b></dt>
      <dd>Range of frequencies that contribute to the normalization.<br>
        There is normally no need to change this option.</dd>
      <dt><b>Normalization mode</b></dt>
      <dd>When normalizing the gain you can chose between quadratic (energy) and
        logarithmic (dB) mode.<br>
        Normalization by <b>energy</b> results in the same amount of energy
        transferred if white noise is passed through the filter. In this mode +3
        dB and -3 dB do not cancel since the first causes twice as much energy
        while the second causes only half of the energy, in average you are
        still at 125%. This mode lowers the gain if the response is changing a
        lot. It usually prevents the audio DAC from overdriving.<br>
        Normalization by <b>dB</b> causes the total loudness to be kept
        approximately. While this sounds useful there are serious drawbacks.
        First of all some frequencies have to be amplified by a significant
        amount. If your samples have been normalized to 0 dB FSR (full
        conduction) it is likely that your sound device overdrive with the
        corrected response. Taking back the master volume will not prevent from
        that on most sound hardware. Secondly an audible resonance usually
        sounds much worse than a frequency notch. So in general normalization by
        energy should be preferred unless you have professional studio
        equipment.</dd>
    </dl>
    <h3>Limiter</h3>
    <p>To get reasonable results extreme corrections have to be avoided. First
      of all to prevent damage from your speakers but also to avoid audible
      artifacts.</p>
    <dl>
      <dt><b>Limit gain</b></dt>
      <dd>Maximum positive gain factor for the correction. If your room response
        falls below this amount no further compensation takes place. <em>Do not
          chose unreasonable high limits</em> to protect your speakers.<br>
        Additionally the gain change rate is smoothed by an IIR filter.</dd>
      <dt><b>Invert high gain values</b></dt>
      <dd>This option cause DRC123 to <i>decrease</i> the gain of frequencies
        that need an amplification beyond the gain limit instead of simply
        clipping to the maximum value.<br>
        The idea is that a speaker should be protected from frequencies that it
        cannot reproduce anyway rather that putting more and more energy into it
        which might cause damage.</dd>
      <dt><b>Limit delay
        </b></dt>
      <dd>Minimum and maximum delay that is compensated by DRC123. This is
        mainly to restrict the required length of the resulting filter kernel.<br>
        Additionally the change rate of the group delay is restricted by an IIR
        filter. Fast changes in the group delay are likely to produce audible
        artifacts.
