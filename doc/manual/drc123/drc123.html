<h2>Digital Room Correction Plug-in for PM123
</h2>
<h3><strong>Welcome to the professional world of digital
signal processing!</strong></h3>
<p>Formerly, specialized hardware was required for DSPs. Nowadays
almost any ordinary computer will do fine.</p>
<h3>Basics</h3>
<p>This plug-in implements the ideas of <a
 href="http://drc-fir.sourceforge.net/">Digital Room
Correction</a>. Unlike the name suggests, this will not only <em>compensate
for resonances of your room</em> but also your <em>speakers
response</em>.</p>
<p>The concept is to do some measurements to characterize your
room and your equipment and calculate an inverse transformation that
will be applied to the sound <i>before</i> it is passed to speakers. <em>You
will be swept off your feet by the results!</em></p>
<p>The DRC123 plug-in features this for PM123. Which other audio player
goes that far?</p>
<h3>Steps</h3>
<ol>
  <li>
    <h4>Prerequisites</h4>
    <p>Whatever you do, you will need a <b><a href="microphone.html">very
linear Microphone</a></b>.
The
quality of the microphone immediately limits the quality of
the compensation. Furthermore the <b><a href="microphone.html#amp">microphone
amplifier</a></b> must also be very linear. You think all
of this is
expensive? It isn't! Read the <a href="microphone.html#recommend">microphone
page</a> for recommendations.</p>
    <p>Secondly you need a <b><a href="soundcard.html">full
duplex sound card</a></b>. Again, you think it is
expensive? It
isn't! Almost any sound device is adequate to your needs, as long as it
operates reliable in the way that it does not drop samples. This
explicitly includes on board devices with a quite bad signal to noise
ratio.</p>
    <p>Oh, well, last but not least you need a <i>sufficiently fast
CPU</i>. But don't fear, anything from 500 MHz up should be fine. The
plug-in is well optimized. (Thanks to the superior <a
 href="http://www.fftw.org/">FFTW library</a>.)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <h4>The Measurement</h4>
    <p>To know what to compensate for you need to do <b><a
 href="measurement.html">at least one measurements</a>
of your sound equipment and listening room</b>. Depending on your sound
card and you measurement setup it might be required to do a single <a
 href="calibration.html">calibration</a>
first.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <h4>The Calculation</h4>
    <p>Now it is time to <a href="calculation.html"><b>calculate
the inverse transformation
function</b></a>. This is the point where <a
 href="http://drc-fir.sourceforge.net/">DRC</a> comes
into play.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <h4>The Compensation</h4>
    <p>Now you are done. You only have to <a href="deconvolution.html">pass
the sound through the inverse
transformation</a>. This is done on the fly by the plug-in. This
step is also called <i>deconvolution</i>.</p>
  </li>
</ol>
<p><em>This plug-in will support all of the steps</em> except
for the prerequisites, of course. <strong>Now listen to the new
crisp
sound!</strong></p>
