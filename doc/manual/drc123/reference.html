    <h2>Reference signals for DRC123 measurements </h2>
    <p>DRC123 uses a special kind of reference signal to get optimal results.
      The reference has the following properties:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>The signal has approximately the energy distribution of <em>white
          noise</em>, but</li>
      <li>the <em>spectrum is <a href="#discrete">discrete</a></em> to get a
        better signal to noise ratio.</li>
      <li>The reference contains only energy in the <em>frequency interval [20
          Hz, 20 kHz]</em>.</li>
      <li>Optionally all frequencies are odd multiples of some base frequency to
        reduce <a href="#distortion">intermodulation noise</a>.</li>
      <li>In stereo mode the left and right channel use distinct frequencies.</li>
      <li>In differential output mode channel 2 is inverted. Special hardware
        can use this to eliminate common mode noise. </li>
    </ul>
    <h3>How does it work? </h3>
    <p>The reference generator uses <em>Inverse Fourier Transform</em> to
      synthesize the output. The Fourier Coefficients are calculated as follows:
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      <table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">
        <tbody>
          <tr>
            <td colspan="1" rowspan="2" valign="middle"><var>magnitude<small><sub>i</sub></small></var>
              =</td>
            <td colspan="1" rowspan="2" valign="middle"><font size="+3">{</font></td>
            <td> <br>
            </td>
            <td valign="middle">&nbsp;0,</td>
            <td> <br>
            </td>
            <td valign="middle">if <var>f</var> &notin; [20, 20000] &or; <var>i</var>
              is even and option is enabled</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>&nbsp;</td>
            <td valign="middle"><var>&nbsp;f</var><sup>-0.2</sup>, </td>
            <td>&nbsp;</td>
            <td valign="middle">if <var>f</var> &isin; [20, 20000] &and; <var>i</var>
              is odd or option is disabled</td>
          </tr>
        </tbody>
      </table>
      <p><var>phase<small><sub>i</sub></small></var> = random()</p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>In stereo mode additionally every second nonzero magnitude is set to zero
      alternating for the left and the right channel. So in fact the two
      channels are measured at slightly different frequencies.</p>
    <p>The result from the Inverse Fourier Transform is <em>normalized</em> and
      then played in an infinite loop until the measurement is stopped.</p>
    <h3><a name="discrete"></a>Random noise with discrete spectrum?</h3>
    <p><i>How can a random noise have a discrete spectrum? And why is it that
        important?</i></p>
    <p>Well, the amount of entropy in the reference signal is limited, because
      the reference is played in a loop. Every repetitive signal has a discrete
      spectrum, that only contains frequencies that are multiples of the
      repetition rate. For the measurement this is important, because not only
      one cycle of the signal is recorded. In fact every <var>N</var>-th
      sample of the recording is added before any further processing, with <var>N</var>
      = FFT length = length until the reference repeats itself (about 2
      seconds). This causes any frequency of the recording that does not fit in
      the reference loop length to be canceled sooner or later. The addition of
      samples with the same period than the reference length effectively
      performs a comb filter perfectly adjusted to the spectrum of the
      reference.</p>
    <p>For this to work it is essential, that the phase of the reference
      playback and the recording is synchronized exactly. In fact the coherence
      length must exceed the entire measurement. Because of tolerances there is
      only one option to satisfy this condition: <strong>playback and recording
        must be done by the same physical sound device</strong>, controlled by
      the same crystal oscillator respectively.</p>
    <h3><a name="distortion"></a>What about nonlinearities?</h3>
    <p><i>Most transfer systems have more or less nonlinearity. Does this impact
        the measurement?</i></p>
    <p>Yes and no. Nonlinearities basically introduce harmonics and
      intermodulation. In the second order (H2) this causes new frequencies to
      appear that are sums and differences of two other frequencies.<br>
      If the reference contains only frequencies that are <i>odd</i> multiples
      of some base frequency (the repetition rate), whatever you do, if you add
      or subtract two of them you will always get an <i>even</i> multiple. This
      frequencies are unused and do not impact the measurement.</p>
    <p>However, nonlinearities may also produce intermodulation terms of <i>three</i>
      frequencies in the signal (i.e. H3). These artifacts will collide with
      other measurement data. But have a look at the logarithmic scale. If you
      add some noise at -30 dB or less you will not even notice a change. So in
      conclusion, the 3rd order distortions will only give any notable impact if
      their intensity is in the order of the dynamic range of your transfer
      function to measure. This is unlikely for room responses, since -30 dB is
      almost silence and you cannot compensate for a loss of this amount anyway.</p>
