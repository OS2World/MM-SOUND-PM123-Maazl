    <h2>Digital Room Correction Plug-in for PM123 </h2>
    <h3><strong>Welcome to the world of professional digital signal processing!</strong></h3>
    <p>Formerly, specialized hardware was required for DSPs. Nowadays almost any
      ordinary computer will do fine.</p>
    <h3>Basics</h3>
    <p>This plug-in implements the ideas of <a href="http://drc-fir.sourceforge.net/">Digital
        Room Correction</a>. Unlike the name suggests, this will not only <em>compensate
for
        resonances of your room</em> but also your <em>speakers response</em>.</p>
    <p>The concept is to do some measurements to characterize your room and your
      equipment and calculate an inverse transformation that will be applied to
      the sound <i>before</i> it is passed to speakers. <em>You will be swept
        off your feet by the results!</em></p>
    <p>The DRC123 plug-in features this for PM123. Which other audio player goes
      that far?</p>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>
        <h4>Prerequisites</h4>
        <p>Whatever you do, you will need a <b><a href="microphone.html">very
              linear Microphone</a></b>. The quality of the microphone
          immediately limits the quality of the compensation. Furthermore the <b><a
              href="microphone.html#amp">microphone amplifier</a></b> must also
          be very linear. You think all of this is very expensive? It isn't!
          Read the <a href="microphone.html#recommend">microphone page</a> for
          recommendations.</p>
        <p>Secondly you need a <b>full duplex sound card</b>. Again, you think
          it is expensive? It isn't! Almost any sound device is adequate to your
          needs, as long as it operates reliable in the way that it does not
          drop samples. This explicitly includes on board devices with a quite
          bad signal to noise ratio.</p>
        <p>Oh, well, last but not least you need a <i>sufficiently fast CPU</i>.
          But don't fear, anything from 5 MHz up should be fine, although I
          recommend twice as much. The plug-in is well optimized. (Thanks to the
          superior <a href="http://www.fftw.org/">FFTW library</a>.)</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <h4>Configuration</h4>
        <p>At the <a href="configuration.html">configuration page</a> select a
          <b>working directory</b> and setup the <b>recording parameters</b>.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <h4>The Measurement</h4>
        <p>To know what to compensate for you need to do <b><a href="measurement.html">at
              least one measurements</a> of your sound equipment and listening
            room</b>. But more than one measurement is strongly recommended.
          Depending on your sound card and you measurement setup it might be
          required to do a single <a href="calibration.html">calibration</a>
          first.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <h4>The Calculation</h4>
        <p>Now it is time to <a href="generate.html"><b>calculate the inverse
              transformation function</b></a>. This is the point where <a href="http://drc-fir.sourceforge.net/">DRC</a>
          comes into play.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <h4>The Compensation</h4>
        <p>Now you are done. You only have to <a href="deconvolution.html">pass
            the sound through the inverse transformation</a>. This is done on
          the fly by the plug-in. This step is also called <i>deconvolution</i>.</p>
      </li>
    </ol>
    <p><em>This plug-in will support all of the steps</em> except for the
      prerequisites, of course. <strong>Now listen to the new crisp sound!</strong></p>
