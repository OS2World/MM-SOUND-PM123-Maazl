    <h2>Basic Configuration</h2>
    <p><img src="images/config.png"><strong></strong></p>
    <h3>Working directory</h3>
    <p>DRC123 is designed to store all related user files in <em>a single
        working directory</em>. If you have different rooms or speakers then it
      is recommended to use different directories.</p>
    <h3>Record URI</h3>
    <p>This is the PM123 URI that connects to your microphone. The most common
      one is <samp>record:///0?samp=48000&amp;stereo&amp;in=line&amp;share=yes</samp>.
      It records from the <em>standard sound device</em> taking the <em>line
        in</em> connector at <em>48 kHz sampling rate</em>.</p>
    <p><img alt="" src="images/cfg-record.png" align="right">If you microphone
      is plugged in somewhere else you need to adjust this. The easiest way is
      to use the record assistant in the context menu of PM123. Once you
      selected the right input press the <i>current</i> button in DRC123's
      configuration dialog. But be careful to <strong>do this at low volume</strong>
      because a feedback loop could be very unpleasant and destroy you tweeters.</p>
