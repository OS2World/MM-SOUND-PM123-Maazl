    <h2>Measurement Microphone for PM123</h2>
    <p>While the properties of the sound card can be compensated by a
      calibration, the properties of the microphone and the microphone amplifier
      can not. They directly cause wrong results and bad sound. </p>
    <h3>Required properties</h3>
    <ol>
      <li><b>Linear frequency response</b><br>
        Any sound modification introduced by the microphone will be compensated
        by DRC123. But there is no such thing to compensate for in playback
        mode. So if your microphone cannot record a certain frequency it will be
        amplified until your microphone can recognize it - a very bad idea.</li>
      <li><b>Omnidirectional characteristics</b><br>
        Your microphones response should not depend on the direction of the
        sound. While this sounds complicated it makes things rather cheaper than
        mor expensive.</li>
      <li><b>Sensitivity</b><br>
        Since your speakers are not close to the microphone it should have
        enough sensitivity to get a reasonable output.</li>
    </ol>
    <h3><a name="types"></a>Mircophone types</h3>
    <p><em>Electret microphones</em> are the very first choice for this purpose.
      They are cheap, omnidirectional and have rather high sensitivity. </p>
    <dl>
      <dt><b>Analog measurement microphones</b></dt>
      <dd>Analog microphones like Bayerdynamic <em>MM-1</em> (also sold as
        t.bone) are <em>usable and sufficient</em>. However, you need a <a href="#amp">microphone
          amplifier</a> with <em>phantom powering</em> to connect it to your
        sound card. A small mixer is the cheapest way to get them working. But
        be sure not to have any filtering activated. </dd>
      <dt><b>Raw electret capsules</b></dt>
      <dd>Raw electret cartridges without any case are a <em>good choice</em>
        as well. They are small and do not modify the sound field very much.
        This causes usually a reasonable good frequency response. You still need
        a <a href="#amp">microphone amplifier</a>, this time with bias power.<br>
        But you should not chose any electret cartridge. Some of them are really
        bad. But there are types that are explicitly designed for measurement
        purposes. Panasonic <em>WM61A</em> is well known to fit the needs.
        Similar models are also sold as Monacor <em>MCE 2500</em>.</dd>
      <dt><b>USB measurement microphones</b></dt>
      <dd> Digital USB microphones like Behringer ECM8000 are <strong>not
          usable</strong>. The reason is that their internal ADC has small
        frequency tolerances. DRC123 needs to suppress ambient noise to a very
        high degree. This is achieved by using frequency windows with a width of
        down to 10<small><sup>-6</sup></small> (1 ppm) and less. No sound device
        will fit this need. You need the <i>selfsame</i> sound device for
        recording and playback for the tolerances to cancel. The result will
        look like this <a href="calibration.html#nomasterclock">example</a>.</dd>
      <dt><b>USB measurement microphones with integrated line out </b></dt>
      <dd>Unlike the stand alone USB microphones the ones with a built-in sound
        output device <strong>perfectly fit the needs</strong>. The hack is
        that the ADC and the DAC share the selfsame crystal oscillator. So the
        frequency tolerances cancel in the same way as they do with an ordinary
        sound card. The difficult task is to get a sound driver for OS/2. </dd>
    </dl>
    <h3><a name="amp"></a>Microphone amplifier </h3>
    <p>First of all the amplifier <em>must match your microphone type</em>.
      Especially because <a href="http://www.epanorama.net/circuits/microphone_powering.html">electret
microphones
        need powering</a>.</p>
    <dl>
      <dt><b>Using the sound cards integrated amplifier</b></dt>
      <dd>Some sound devices have built in microphone amplifiers. Although it is
        obvious to use them unfortunately their <strong>quality</strong> is
        mostly <strong>very poor</strong>. Furthermore there are different and
        incompatible concepts for microphone powering. </dd>
