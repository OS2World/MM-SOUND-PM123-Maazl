    <h2>Measure room response</h2>
    <p><img src="images/measure.png"><strong></strong></p>
    <h3>Prerequisites</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>First of all you need a <a href="microphone.html">measurement
          microphone</a>.</li>
      <li>Secondly you microphone needs a microphone amplifier. While most PC
        sound devices have such an amplifier most of them are often of rather
        poor quality and not suitable for measurement purposes. So I recommend
        to use an external one. </li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Setup</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Be sure to have <a href="configuration.html">configured DRC123</a>
        properly.</li>
      <li>Optionally select a a <a href="calibration.html">sound card
          calibration</a> file made before.</li>
      <li>Select a calibration file for your <a href="microphone.html">microphone</a>
        if possible.</li>
      <li>Set all sound controls of your amplifier (like bass, treble, balance)
        to zero or push <i>direct sound</i> button.</li>
      <li>Disable any effect processors, equalizers (like RealEQ) and so on.</li>
      <li>It might be required to do some adjustments in the <a href="measurementext.html">extended
          measurement options page</a>.</li>
    </ul>
    <h4><img alt="" src="images/mes-ref.png" align="right" height="183" hspace="5"
        vspace="5" width="440">Measure <em>with external loopback</em>
      reference and <em>external microphone amplifier</em> </h4>
    <p>Check the option <i>reference input</i> and use the setup shown in the
      image.</p>
    <p>If you have the option, use a special cable that returns a mix of line
      out left and right line input. This will compensate for almost any
      properties of your sound device. The mix can be done with two 10 k&#937; metal
      film resistors as shown at the right. This will only work if you use an
      external microphone amplifier, because the microphone input has a too high
      sensitivity and is often only mono.</p>
    <h4><img alt="" src="images/mes-std.png" align="right" height="145" hspace="5"
        vspace="5" width="360">Measure <em>without loopback</em> reference and
      <em>external microphone amplifier</em></h4>
    <p>Uncheck the option <i>reference input</i> and use the setup shown in the
      image.
    </p>
    <p>If you do not have the option for the loopback above DRC123 can also use
      an internal loopback. In this case it is recommended to measure only in
      stereo mode because otherwise the delay between the left and the right
      channel is unknown and will cannot be compensated. Furthermore you should
      <em>work with a calibration</em> in this case.</p>
    <h3>Do the <em>measurements</em></h3>
    <ol>
      <li>Place <b>the microphone</b> at a <b>location</b> where you intend to
        listen music. Remember to use approximately the same altitude than your
        ears.</li>
      <li>Select <b>mode <i>Noise</i></b> (default).</li>
      <li>Select the <b>channels</b> to measure.</li>
      <li>Press <b><i>Run</i></b> button.</li>
      <li> Adjust the <b>volume</b> to get a reasonable recording level.</li>
      <li><b>Avoid</b> any <b>noise</b> in the room during the measurement.
        Neither move items nor your body.</li>
      <li><b>Wait</b> until the results are reasonable smooth and stable. The
        indeterminate phase rate below the graph is a good indicator for the
        quality of the measurement. Good values are at 40 and less.</li>
      <li>Press <b><i>Abort/Stop</i></b> button.</li>
      <li>Enter a <b>description</b> to identify your measurement (optional).</li>
      <li>Enter a <b>file name</b> - without extension.</li>
      <li>Press <i><b>Save</b></i> button to save the result.</li>
      <li><b>Repeat</b> the procedure for different microphone locations.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>It is not required that the response is approximately at 0 dB.</p>
    <p>Repeat the procedure for different locations of the microphone and save
      the result to different file names.<br>
      It is not required that all measurements are done with exactly the same
      parameters. But if you measure the left and right channel separately you
      must not change anything between this measurements.</p>
    <h3>Verification</h3>
    <p>If you want to verify the results from DRC123 you may check the <i>Verification
        mode</i> box. This will apply the currently selected <a href="deconvolution.html">deconvolution
        filter</a> to the reference signal before output. This is how your music
      is played with DRC123. Ideally the response should be flat in this mode,
      but usually there are some residuals because the correction is not exact
      and the response depends highly on the microphone position.</p>
