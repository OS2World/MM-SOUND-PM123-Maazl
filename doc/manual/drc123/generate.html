    <h2>Generate filter kernel</h2>
    <p><img src="images/generate.png"></p>
    <h3>Select measurements</h3>
    <p>Select at least one measurement as template for the filter kernel. It is
      a good advise to use <em>multiple measurements</em> taken at different
      locations. You can select from all measurement files in the <a href="configuration.html">working
        directory</a>.</p>
    <p>If you want to optimize the result for a certain listening position in
      the room then select multiple measurements that are taken close to this
      position.</p>
    <p>If you prefer to get a compromise that does not sound ugly when you move
      around in the room then take measurements from entirely different
      locations. DRC123 will take back the level at resonant frequencies in
      doubt to avoid resonances. If a certain region is your preferred listening
      place then select more measurements from this area.</p>
    <h3>Generate the filter</h3>
    <ol>
      <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Press the <span style="font-style: italic;">Generate</span>
          button</span> and wait for the operation to complete. This usually
        takes only a few seconds.<br>
        You will see the result in the embedded <a href="graphs.html">graphs</a>.
        Note that the filter is the <em>inverse response</em>, i.e. high gain
        values are low gain in your room response and vice versa.</li>
      <li>Enter a <span style="font-weight: bold;">file name</span>. Because of
        the asynchronous processing you can do this while the calculation of
        step 1 is still running.</li>
      <li>Enter a <span style="font-weight: bold;">descriptive text</span>.
        This will help you to select the right filter in playback mode.</li>
      <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Save</span> the result.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>If you are experienced or you just want to play around with the settings
      also have a look at the <a href="generateext.html">filter generation
        options</a>.</p>
    <h3>View result</h3>
    <p>There are three view modes. The default is to <span style="font-weight: bold;">show
        only the result</span>. The boundary bars show the minimum and the
      maximum of the contributing measurements.</p>
    <p>The other two modes show either the <span style="font-weight: bold;">gain
        response</span> of the <span style="font-weight: bold;">group delay</span>
      of all contributing measurements (at most 11). This can be used to compare
      measurements. Note that you always need to generate the filter when you
      have selected other measurements.</p>
