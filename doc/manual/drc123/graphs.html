<h2>Spectrum graphs of DRC123</h2>
<h3>Axes
</h3>
<dl>
  <dt><b>X axis - frequency</b></dt>
  <dd>The X axis show the logarithmic frequency from 20 Hz to 20 kHz.
The short cut label <b><tt>k2</tt></b> stands for 0.2 kHz = 200 Hz.
(The SI prefix k for 1000 replaces the decimal point to conserve space.)</dd>
  <dt><b>Y axis - amplitude</b></dt>
  <dd>The left Y axis shows the amplitude response in dB.<br>
It is used for all amplitude graphs identified by <b><tt>&lt;</tt></b>
at the left of the label.</dd>
  <dt><b>Y axis - <a href="#group_delay">group delay</a></b></dt>
  <dd>The right Y axis is the group delay in units of the current
frequencies cycle time. I.e. a value of 2 at 80 Hz corresponds to 2 /
80 s = 25 ms (two cycles).<br>
It is used for all delay graphs identified by <b><tt>&gt;</tt></b> at
the right of the label.</dd>
</dl>
<p>If a Y value leaves the graph a line is drawn at the top or bottom
boundary respectively. So you can see whether the values are to high or
to low.</p>
<h3>Numbers</h3>
All numbers are written in short scientific form where the SI prefix
replaces the decimal dot. E.g.:<br>
2k = 2000<br>
k18 = 0,18k = 180<br>
<h3>Graph labels</h3>
<dl>
  <dt><b>&lt;</b>, <b>&gt;</b></dt>
  <dd>The angle brackets show whether the graph uses the left or the
right Y axis.<br>
  </dd>
  <dt><b>L gain</b>, <b>R gain</b></dt>
  <dd>Amplitude of the <u>l</u>eft/<u>r</u>ight channel in dB using
the left Y axis.</dd>
  <dt><b>L delay</b>, <b>R delay</b></dt>
  <dd>Group delay of the <u>l</u>eft/<u>r</u>ight channel in seconds.</dd>
  <dt><b>L ph. del.</b>, <b>R ph. del.</b></dt>
  <dd>Group delay of the <u>l</u>eft/<u>r</u>ight channel in units of
degrees of the current frequencies cycle time.</dd>
  <dt><b>R2L</b>, <b>L2R</b></dt>
  <dd>Cross talk from right to left/left to right channel in dB using
the left Y axis.<br>
The values usually increase at higher frequencies because of the white
noise floor of your line input which has increased energy compared to
the pink noise of the <a href="reference.html">reference signal</a>.
The noise decrease with measurement time. </dd>
  <dt><b>&#916; gain</b></dt>
  <dd>Difference between the left and the right channel in dB using the
left Y axis.</dd>
  <dt><b>&#916; delay</b></dt>
  <dd>Time delay between the left and the right channel in degrees
using the right Y axis.</dd>
  <dt><b>L IM2</b>, <b>R IM2</b></dt>
  <dd>Second order intermodulations of the left/right channel. This is
the energy at frequencies that can be expressed as sum or difference of
exactly two other frequencies.<br>
The values usually increase at higher frequencies because of the white
noise floor of your line input which has increased energy compared to
the pink noise of the <a href="reference.html">reference signal</a>. </dd>
</dl>
<h3><a name="group_delay"></a>Group delay</h3>
<p>The group delay is the <em>phase change over frequency</em>. The
absolute phase is mostly meaningless because of delays due to CPU
processing and sound propagation. But the phase changes are significant
and contribute to the acoustical ranging.</p>
