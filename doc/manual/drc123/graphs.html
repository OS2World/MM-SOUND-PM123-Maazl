    <h2>Spectrum graphs of DRC123</h2>
    <h3>Axes
    </h3>
    <dl>
      <dt><b>X axis - frequency</b></dt>
      <dd>The X axis show the logarithmic frequency in <b>Hz</b>, usually from
        20 Hz to 20 kHz.
        The short cut label <b><tt>k2</tt></b> stands for 0.2 kHz = 200 Hz. See
        number format below.</dd>
      <dt><b>Y axis - amplitude</b></dt>
      <dd>The left Y axis shows the amplitude response in <b>dB</b>.<br>
        It is used for all amplitude graphs identified by <b><tt>&lt;</tt></b>
        at the left of the label.</dd>
      <dt><b>Y axis - <a href="#group_delay">group delay</a> for calibration<a
            href="#group_delay"><br>
          </a></b></dt>
      <dd>The right Y axis in the calibration graph is the group delay in units
        of the current
        frequencies cycle time measured in <b>degrees</b>. I.e. a value of 90
        at 80 Hz corresponds to 90 / 360 /
        80 s = 25 ms (a quarter cycle). It is used for all delay graphs
        identified by <b><tt>&gt;</tt></b> at
        the right of the label.</dd>
      <dt><b>Y axis - <a href="#group_delay">group delay</a> for measurements<a
            href="#group_delay"><br>
          </a></b></dt>
      <dd>The right Y axis in measurement graphs is the group delay in <b>seconds</b>.</dd>
    </dl>
    <p>If a Y value leaves the graph a line is drawn at the top or bottom
      boundary respectively. So you can see whether the values are to high or
      to low.</p>
    <h3>Numbers</h3>
    <p>
      All numbers are written in short scientific form to conserve space where
      the SI prefix
      replaces the decimal dot. E.g.:<br>
      2k = 2000<br>
      -k18 = -0.18k = -180</p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <h3>Graph labels</h3>
    <dl>
      <dt><b>&lt;</b>, <b>&gt;</b></dt>
      <dd>The angle brackets show whether the graph uses the left or the
        right Y axis. </dd>
      <dt><b>L gain</b>, <b>R gain</b></dt>
      <dd>Amplitude of the <u>l</u>eft/<u>r</u>ight channel in dB using
        the left Y axis.</dd>
      <dt><b>L delay</b>, <b>R delay</b></dt>
      <dd>Group delay of the <u>l</u>eft/<u>r</u>ight channel in seconds.</dd>
      <dt><b>L ph. del.</b>, <b>R ph. del.</b></dt>
      <dd>Group delay of the <u>l</u>eft/<u>r</u>ight channel in units of
        degrees of the current frequencies cycle time.</dd>
      <dt><b>R2L</b>, <b>L2R</b></dt>
      <dd>Cross talk from right to left/left to right channel in dB using
        the left Y axis.<br>
        The values usually increase at higher frequencies because of the white
        noise floor of your line input which has increased energy compared to
        the pink noise of the <a href="reference.html">reference signal</a>.
        The noise decrease with measurement time. </dd>
      <dt><b>&#916; gain</b></dt>
      <dd>Difference between the left and the right channel in dB using the
        left Y axis.</dd>
      <dt><b>&#916; delay</b></dt>
      <dd>Time delay between the left and the right channel in degrees
        using the right Y axis.</dd>
      <dt><b>L IM2</b>, <b>R IM2</b></dt>
      <dd>Second order intermodulations of the left/right channel. This is
        the energy at frequencies that can be expressed as sum or difference of
        exactly two other frequencies.<br>
        The values usually increase at higher frequencies because of the white
        noise floor of your line input which has increased energy compared to
        the pink noise of the <a href="reference.html">reference signal</a>. </dd>
    </dl>
    <h3>Boundary graphs</h3>
    <p>In addition to the dark graphs most views also show boundary graphs in <b>lighter
        colors</b>. Most measurements are noisy and the boundary graphs show you
      the <b>minimum and maximum</b> values that contributed. The dark graphs
      show only average values. The detail level automatically scales with the
      graph size.</p>
    <h3><a name="group_delay"></a>Group delay</h3>
    <p>The <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Group_delay">group delay</a>
      is the <em>phase change over frequency</em>. The
      absolute phase is mostly meaningless because of delays due to CPU
      processing and sound propagation. But the phase <i>changes</i> are
      significant
      and contribute to the acoustical ranging. The average delay is shown as
      text at the bottom of the graph. It might be different for the right and
      the left channel due to path difference.</p>
    <h4>Indeterminate phase</h4>
    <p>Also at the bottom of group delay graphs there is an info about phase
      unwrapping. Because the test signals from DRC123 are repetitive and the
      impulse response of your room is non-repetitive there might be ambiguities
      whether some response is from the current or the last cycle. DRC123 tries
      to identify and count this ambiguities. The less the better.</p>
