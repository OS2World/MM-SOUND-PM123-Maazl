<b><font size=+2>PM123's Remote Control</font></b>
<p>PM123 can be remotely controlled via a <i>named pipe</i>, <tt>\PIPE\PM123</tt>.
Named pipes were chosen because of their excellent features. Quoting from
the <i>Control Program Programming Guide and Reference</i>: "Named pipes
enable related or unrelated processes on either the same computer system
or different systems to communicate with each other. Any process that knows
the name of a pipe can open and use a named pipe. In addition, named pipe
data can be transparently redirected across a network, such as a local
area network (LAN)".
<p>To remote control PM123 on the same computer, you can use either the
built-in "<tt>echo</tt>" command, or the PM123 executable itself. PM123
understands a set of commands that are written to the pipe. For example,
<pre>
        [c:\usr\pm123] pm123 -cmd volume 80
        [c:\usr\pm123] echo *volume 80 > \pipe\pm123
</pre>
These commands will set the volume to 80%.
<pre>
        [c:\usr\pm123] pm123 -cmd add d:\music\test.mp3
        [c:\usr\pm123] echo *add d:\music\test.mp3 > \pipe\pm123
</pre>
These commands will add the file <tt>d:\music\test.mp3</tt> to the playlist.
<p>If you use <tt>echo</tt>, remember to prepend any commands sent to it
with a <tt>*</tt> character. PM123 currently understands the following
commands (optional parameters are enclosed in parenthesis):

<p>Now for the cool part. You can control PM123 over your OS/2 Local Area
Network. Just use <tt>\\SERVER\PIPE\PM123</tt>. <tt>\\SERVER</tt>
is the name of the computer PM123 runs on. For example,
<pre>
        [c:\usr\pm123] pm123 -cmd \\mycomputer volume 80
        [c:\usr\pm123] echo *volume 80 > \\mycomputer\pipe\pm123
        [c:\usr\pm123] pm123 -cmd \\mycomputer add d:\music\test.mp3
        [c:\usr\pm123] echo *add d:\music\test.mp3 > \\mycomputer\pipe\pm123
</pre>
Will do the same as examples above, but from a different computer. Easy,
isn't it?
