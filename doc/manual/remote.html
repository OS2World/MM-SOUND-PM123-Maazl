<h2>PM123's Remote Control</h2>
<p>PM123 can be remotely controlled via a <i>named pipe</i>,
<tt>\PIPE\PM123</tt> by default. You can alter this default by the
  <a href="settings2.html">remote control settings</a>
  of the <a href="properties.html">properties dialog</a>.</p>  
<p>Named pipes were chosen because of their excellent features. Quoting from
  the <i>Control Program Programming Guide and Reference</i>:
  "Any process that knows the name of a pipe can open and use a named pipe.
  In addition, named pipe data can be transparently redirected across a network,
  such as a local area network (LAN)".</p>
<p>To remote control PM123 on the same computer, you can use either the
  built-in "<tt>echo</tt>" command, or the PM123 executable itself. PM123
  understands a set of commands that are written to the pipe. For example:</p>
<blockquote>
<pre>[c:\usr\pm123] pm123 -cmd volume 80<br>[c:\usr\pm123] echo *volume 80 &gt; \pipe\pm123</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>These commands will set the volume to 80%.</p>
<blockquote>
<pre>[c:\usr\pm123] pm123 -cmd add d:\music\test.mp3
[c:\usr\pm123] echo *add d:\music\test.mp3 &gt; \pipe\pm123</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>These commands will add the file <tt>d:\music\test.mp3</tt> to the default playlist.</p>
<p>If you use <tt>echo</tt>, remember to prepend any commands sent to it
  with a <tt>*</tt> character.</p>
<p>Now for the cool part. You can control PM123 over your OS/2
  Local Area Network. Just use <tt>\\<var>SERVER</var>\PIPE\PM123</tt>.
<tt>\\<var>SERVER</var></tt> is the name of the computer PM123 runs on. For example,</p>
<blockquote>
<pre>[c:\usr\pm123] pm123 -cmd \\mycomputer volume 80
[c:\usr\pm123] echo *volume 80 &gt; \\mycomputer\pipe\pm123<br>[c:\usr\pm123] pm123 -cmd \\mycomputer add d:\music\test.mp3<br>[c:\usr\pm123] echo *add d:\music\test.mp3 &gt; \\mycomputer\pipe\pm123</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>Will do the same as examples above, but from a different computer. Easy, isn't it?</p>
