    <h2>PM123's Real Equalizer</h2>
    <p>The <b>Real Equalizer</b> plug-in provides a 1/3-octave equalizer and
      professional sound quality. The plug-in is provided with PM123 and is
      located in file <tt>REALEQ.DLL</tt>. You can display the configuration
      window by selecting the <em>Real Equalizer</em> item in the Plug-ins sub
      menu of PM123's <a href="../mainmenu.html">main menu</a> or by pressing
      the <em>Configure</em> button in the <a href="../properties.html">properties
        dialog</a>, page Plug-ins 2/2. </p>
    <blockquote> <img src="images/realeq.png"> </blockquote>
    <p>The equalizer is complete controlled by this dialog. All changes are
      immediately applied to the sound processing engine.<br>
      Nevertheless it may take up to a few seconds for the changes to take
      effect, because there are already processed samples in the buffer of the
      output plug-in. </p>
    <ol>
      <li>
        <p>Check&nbsp;this box to <b>enable the RealEQ</b> operation. If it is
          unchecked all other settings have no effect and RealEQ does not
          consume CPU resources on playback.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>These are the <b>main control sliders</b>. They allow to adjust each
          frequency in a range of ±12dB.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>The mute check boxes can be used to exclude some frequencies from the
          spectrum. This can be useful for testing purposes.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>If you check <b>Lock Left/Right</b> all changes to the slides or
          mute check boxes are immediately reflected to the other channel.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>The <b>master controls</b> affect the whole channel. You might say
          this is redundant to the volume slider. It is not. Most sounds come in
          16 bits resolution and are (nearly) normalized to 0dB FSR. This causes
          the sound to overdrive easily if one of the lower frequency sliders
          (up to about 200Hz) is significantly above zero. Take back the master
          volume of RealEQ in case of distortions and raise the volume of your
          amplifier instead.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Here you can switch between the <b>frequency spectrum</b> and the <b>group
            delay</b> view. The group delay is a completely independent set of
          sliders that introduce a frequency dependent delay into the sound. You
          can adjust the delay in the range of ± 12 milliseconds for each
          frequency. You may wonder that negative values are possible. Never
          fear, we don't break Einstein's rules. RealEQ simply prefetches some
          samples from the decoder plug-in before they are really played.
          Setting large group delays at low frequencies will degrade the
          frequency response of the equalizer and/or require a larger FIR order.<br>
          Negative group delays can be used to compensate for delays of
          resonances of vented enclosures, room resonances or passive speaker
          crossovers. If you don't know what I am talking about simply keep all
          group delay sliders at zero.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Here you can adjust the working precision of the equalizer engine.
          The FIR order controls the accuracy. And the FFT plan size controls
          the latency and the CPU usage. But the plan size must always be
          significantly larger than the FIR order. Reasonable values are:

                <th>Quality</th>

              </tr>

                <td>high precision</td>

              </tr>
              <tr>
                <td>balanced</td>
                <td>8192</td>
                <td>16384</td>
              </tr>
              <tr>
                <td>low CPU usage</td>
                <td>4096</td>
                <td>8192</td>
              </tr>
            </tbody>
          </table>
          However, the CPU load is moderate even at high precision. &nbsp;A
          400&nbsp;MHz CPU will be sufficient to operate at the maximum
          precision. But you may get objectionable latencies, if you do seek
          operations or other user interactions where the output buffers have to
          be filled again. In fact reducing the number of buffers of the output
          plug-in is the most efficient way to reduce this latencies.</p>
