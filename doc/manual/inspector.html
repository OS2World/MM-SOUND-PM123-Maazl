<h2>PM123's Inspector Window</h2>
<p>The Inspector Window tells you what is currently going on in
the PM123 engine. Normally you should not need it. It is activated by
pressing <em>Alt+Shift+I</em> in PM123's main window.

<h3>Controller Queue</h3>
<p>The Controller Queue shows what commands are currently about
to be executed. The Syntax is: <kbd><var>FCommand
</var></kbd>[<kbd><var>arguments</var></kbd>].</p>
<dl>
  <dt><kbd><var>F</var></kbd>
- flag</dt>
  <dd><kbd>*</kbd>&nbsp;- currently
in work by a worker thread<br>
    <kbd>-</kbd>&nbsp;- to do later<br>
    <kbd>+</kbd>&nbsp;- adjacent
to the previous command, executed only if the previous command succeeded</dd>
  <dt><kbd><var>Command</var>&nbsp;</kbd>[<kbd><var>arguments</var></kbd>]</dt>
  <dd>control commands like <kbd>PlayStop</kbd>, <kbd>Navigate</kbd>
(e.g.
Seek), <kbd>Load</kbd> or <kbd>LocationQuery</kbd>
(GUI updates of the current playing time)</dd>
</dl>
<p>The controller queue is always executed strictly in order.</p>
<h3>Worker Queue</h3>
<p>The worker queue is used to obtain certain informations about
any kind of playable objects. The syntax is: <kbd><var>F</var>[<var>QQQQQQQQQQ</var>
-&gt; <var>WWWWWWWWWW</var>] <var>URL</var></kbd>.</p>
<dl>
  <dt><kbd><var>F</var></kbd>&nbsp;-
flag</dt>
  <dd><kbd>+</kbd> - Low priority request: currently in work by a
worker thread.<br>
    <kbd>-</kbd>&nbsp;- Low priority request: no worker is currently
available. To do later.<br>
    <kbd>#</kbd> - High priority request: currently in work by a
worker thread.<br>
    <kbd>=</kbd> - High priority request: no worker is currently
available. To do later. </dd>
  <dt><kbd><var>QQQQQQQQQQ</var></kbd>&nbsp;-
request flags</dt>
  <dd>Kind of information that is requested: <kbd>ptomacrdis</kbd><br>
    <kbd>p</kbd>&nbsp;- physical
information&nbsp;like file size<br>
    <kbd>t</kbd>&nbsp;- technical information like bit
rate and number of channels<br>
    <kbd>o</kbd> - object information like playing time<br>
    <kbd></kbd><kbd>m</kbd>&nbsp;- meta information like artist
and title</dd>
  <dd><kbd></kbd><kbd>a</kbd> - attribute information like last playing
position</dd>
  <dd><kbd></kbd><kbd>c</kbd> - children (playlist content)</dd>
  <dd><kbd>r</kbd>&nbsp;- recursive playlist information like total
number of songs</dd>
  <dd><kbd>d</kbd> - detailed recursive playlist information like total
playing time</dd>
  <dd><kbd>i</kbd> - playlist item information like start position and
alias name</dd>
  <dd><kbd>s</kbd> - slice information (effective start and stop
position)<br>
    <em>Uppercase</em> letters are <em>high priority
requests</em> where a user is likely to be waiting for. E.g. when
an item is loaded into the player.</dd>
  <dt><kbd><var>WWWWWWWWWW</var></kbd>&nbsp;-
in work flags</dt>
  <dd>The second block identifies the kind of information that is
currently in work. It uses the same format <kbd>PTOMACRDIS</kbd>
as the request flags. Sometimes the information in work is more than
requested. E.g. it might be cheap to return format information if only
the total playing time is requested.</dd>
  <dt><kbd><var>URL</var></kbd></dt>
  <dd>This is the object for which the information is requested.</dd>
</dl>
<h3>Refresh</h3>
The Inspector dialog is not automatically
refreshed when the information in the queues changes. Instead the
refresh
is done either manual or timer based. Be careful not to set the auto
refresh rate too high to avoid a performance impact.
