<h2>PM123's Logarithmic Volume Control Plug-in (LOGVOLUM)</h2>
<p>This filter plug-in compensates for non-natural linear mixer controls of cheap sound devices
  and give the volume bar of PM123 a nearly logarithmic characteristic.
</p><p>You should not use this plug-in if your sound card already has a mixer with a logarithmic characteristic.
  You may check what kind of device you have with a <strong>simple test</strong>:
  Turn PM123's volume slider from maximum down to 50% while playing.
  If the volume decreases only a bit, you have a linear control
  and you should activate this plug-in.

  The <font color="#ff0000">red </font> line is the response function with the correction.<br>
  The <font color="#00cc00">green </font> line is the response function of usual sound devices
  <em>without</em> this plug-in.
</p><p>Instead of an exponential function the plug-in uses the polynomial:<br>
  <img alt="y = x / (1 + sqrt(10) * (1 - x))" src="images/logvolume_formula.png"><br>
  with x and y in the range [0,1] for the transformation. This
  gives an approximately exponential function with a usable dynamic range
  of almost 30&nbsp;dB while keeping the zero point at -&infin;&nbsp;dB.
