<h2>PM123's Logarithmic volume control in OS2AUDIO</h2>
<p>This technique compensates for non-natural linear mixer controls of
cheap sound devices and give the volume bar of PM123 a reasonable
characteristic.
</p>
<p>You should not use this plug-in if your sound card already has a
mixer with a logarithmic characteristic. You may check what kind of
device you have with a <em>simple test</em>: turn PM123's volume
slider from maximum down to 50% while playing. If the volume decreases
only a bit, you have a linear control and you should activate this
plug-in.

The <font color="#ff0000">red </font> line is the response function
with the correction.<br>
The <font color="#00cc00">green </font> line is the response function
of cheap sound devices <em>without</em> this correction.
</p>
<p>Instead of an exponential function the plug-in uses the polynomial:<br>
<img alt="y = x / (1 + sqrt(10) * (1 - x))"

with x and y in the range [0,1] for the transformation. This gives an
approximately exponential function with a usable dynamic range of
almost 30&nbsp;dB while keeping the zero point at -&#8734;&nbsp;dB.
