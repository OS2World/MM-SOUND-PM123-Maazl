<h2>PM123's Playlists</h2>

    move or copy items between different playlist or playlist manager windows
    or drop file or URL objects from other applications. In the latter case only shadows are allowed
    since playlists only contain references to the original objects. 
    You cannot drop PM123 objects on other applications.

<p>If the playlist is modified '<tt>(*)</tt>' will show up in the window title.
  However, you won't see if a nested playlist is modified.
  
</p><h3>The Default Playlist</h3>
<p>PM123 has a special default playlist file named "PM123.LST" in your PM123 folder.
  This file is used to hold a sequence of objects if you load more than one file to the player.
  <strong>You should not use the default playlist for your favorite songs</strong> since it is overwritten
  each time it is needed for other purposes.
