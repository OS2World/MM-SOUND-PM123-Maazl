<h2>PM123's Playlists</h2>

  PM123 also understands <tt>.MPL</tt> files used by WarpAMP and <tt>.M3U</tt> playlists used over the Internet.

<h3>Window features</h3>
<dl>
  <dt><b>Direct manipulation</b>
  <dd>You can edit the <i>alias name</i>, the <a href="slicing.html"><i>start</i> and <i>stop offsets</i></a> and the source URL by direct manipulation.
    Note that changing the the name does not change any file name.
    It only changes the display string of the item in this playlist.
    This is e.g. used to label <a href="bookmark.html">bookmarks</a>.
  <dt><b>Drag and Drop</b>
  <dd>You can use <a href="dragndrop.html">Drag and Drop</a> to rearrange the items in a playlist,
    move or copy items between different playlist or playlist manager windows
    or drop file or URL objects from other applications. In the latter case only shadows are allowed
    since playlists only contain references to the original objects. 
    You cannot drop PM123 objects on other applications.
  <dt><b>Context menu</b>
  <dd>With the right mouse button you can invoke the <a href="playlist_cm.html">context menu of the entire list</a>
    or the <a href="playlist_cmi.html">context menu of the selected item(s)</a>.
  <dt><b>Keayboard accelerators</b>
  <dd>You may use the <a href="keyboard.html">accelerator keys</a> to call functions from the context menu quickly.
  <dt><b>Icons</b>
  <dd>The <a href="icons.html">icons</a> show the type and the status of playlist item.
</dl>

<p>If the playlist is modified '<tt>(*)</tt>' will show up in the window title.
  However, you won't see if a nested playlist is modified.
  
<h3>The Default Playlist</h3>
<p>PM123 has a special default playlist file named "PM123.LST" in your PM123 folder.
  This file is used to hold a sequence of objects if you load more than one file to the player.
  <em>You should not use this file for your favorite playlist</em> since it is overwritten
  each time it is needed for other purposes.
