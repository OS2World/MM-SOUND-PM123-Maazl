<h2>Format of the PM123 playlist files</h2>
  This format is used for PM123 playlists as well as for bookmarks, playlist manager and most recent use lists.
  The files are upwardly and downwardly compatible to the files of older PM123 releases, concerning the least common denominator. 
<h4>Header</h4>

<pre>#
# Playlist created with PM123 1.40 alpha 3
# Do not modify!
# Lines starting with '&gt;' are used by Playlist Manager.
