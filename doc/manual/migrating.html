<h2>Migrating to PM123 1.40</h2>
<p>There are some major changes in the GUI that you should be
aware of when moving from an earlier version. The most important ones
are listed below. For further information see the <a href="../History.txt">change log</a>. See also the <a href="compatibility.html">compatibility issues</a> if
you want to continue using earlier PM123 versions.</p>
<h3>Main window</h3>
<h4>Song title</h4>
<p>You must use a <strong>double click</strong> to
change the title display. This prevents from switching the style
accidentally.</p>
<h4>Visual plug-in</h4>

<h4>Alternate navigation</h4>
<blockquote>

<p>While playing a playlist you can navigate with the slider
through the entire list by pressing the <em>Alt key</em>.
The exact behavior is controlled by the <a href="settings1.html">navigation
settings</a> of the <a href="properties.html">properties
dialog</a>. </p>
<h4>Equalizer has vanished</h4>
<p>Well, that's true. The simple equalizer from the context menu
has been removed because the only plug-in that supported it was mpg123.
Any other plug-in including WAV and Ogg-Vorbis playback silently
ignored it. This caused the sound to depend on the encoding and to
change within playlists. A bad thing.</p>
<p>I recommend to use the powerful <a href="realeq.html">RealEQ
plug-in</a> as an alternative. If you do not care about its
precision use conservative setting like an FIR order of 4096.</p>
<p>If you do not like this alternative or it eats too much CPU
for your purposes, you have to wait for a parametric EQ plug-in which
uses very fast IIR filters. This will require nearly no CPU cycles and
work with any source although. However, one must do the job.</p>
<h3>Playlist windows</h3>
<img src="images/playlist.png">
<p>Playlists, the playlist manager and bookmarks are now
basically the same thing. Furthermore you can <em>open
multiple playlists</em>. That means:</p>
<ul>
<li>The <a href="playlist.html">Playlist
Window</a> is now nothing more than a <em>detailed
view</em> of a playlist.</li>
<li>The <em>playlist button</em> will open
the <em>default playlist</em>.</li>
<li>The default playlist is used if you drop more than one
object on the player.<br>
So, <strong>do not use the default playlist for anything that you want to keep</strong>.</li>
<li>The <a href="manager.html">Playlist
Manager</a> is a <em>tree view</em>
of another default playlist, which usually contains other playlists, of
course.</li>
<li>The <a href="bookmark.html" herf="bookmark.html">bookmark
editor</a> is now a detailed view of a special
playlist that is visualized in the player's context menu.</li>
<li>You can use drag &amp; drop and direct manipulation to modify
all of the above.</li>
<li>Different views of the same content are immediately
synchronized as long they are part of the same PM123 instance.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Nested playlists</h4>
<p>Playlists may contain other playlists and they may contain
further playlists and so on. This has the following effects:</p>
<ul>
<li>All items of a child playlist are played when the playback
reaches the sublist and before PM123 continues in the parent list.</li>
<li>In shuffle mode items in different sublists are not
interchanged.</li>
<li>The PM123 main window flattens the nested lists and shows
always the index and the time offsets within all Song items in the
nested list structure. To see what's going on open a tree view of the
currently played list ('<a href="mainmenu.html">Context
menu</a>/Current Playlist/Show tree view' or simply 'Ctrl+T').</li>
<li>Nested playlists in the bookmark list cause sub menus.</li>
<li>When the playlists are nested recursively the player will
ignore sublists that are already in the call stack. This avoids an
infinite recursion.</li>
</ul>
<h4>File system folders</h4>
<p>PM123 is able to play the content of <a href="urlformat.html#file_folder">file system folders</a>
directly without the need to load all files into a playlist. This works
as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>The content of a folder is handled as a <em>virtual
playlist</em>.</li>
<li>Optionally sub folders are virtualized as nested playlists
too.</li>
<li>Unplayable files are skipped during playback but shown in
the folder views.</li>
<li>Changes in the file system are reflected to PM123 when
PM123 is restarted or a folder is manually refreshed.</li>
<li>If a folder is selected in the open dialog or by drag and
drop the content is no longer copied into a real playlist.</li>
</ul>
<p>This feature also changed the behavior when <em>dropping
a folder</em> at PM123. The objects in the folder are no longer
expanded immediately. Instead, they are read when the folder is
actually played. This allows to reflect changes to the folder to PM123.
See <a href="dragndrop.html">Drag &amp; Drop</a>
for further details.<br>
To get the old behavior add the folder to a <a href="playlist.html">playlist</a>
and choose 'Flatten' from the <a href="playlist_cmi.html">context
menu</a> of the folder.</p>
