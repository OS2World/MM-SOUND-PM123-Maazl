<h2>Migrating to PM123 1.40</h2>
<p>There are some major changes in the GUI that you should be aware of when moving
  from an earlier version. The most important ones are listed below.
  For further information see the <a href="../History.txt">change log</a>.</p>

<h3>Main window</h3>
<h4>Visual plug-in</h4>
<p>You must use a <strong>double click</strong> to change the visual plug-in style.
  This prevents from switching the style accidentally.</p>
<h4>Alternate navigation</h4>
<blockquote>

</blockquote>
<p>While playing a playlist you can navigate with the slider through the entire list
  by pressing the <strong>Alt key</strong>.
  The exact behavior is controlled by the <a href="settings2.html">navigation settings</a>
  of the <a href="properties.html">properties dialog</a>.  
</p><h4>Equalizer has vanished</h4>
<p>Well, that's true.
  The simple equalizer from the context menu has been removed because the only
  plug-in that supported it was mpg123. Any other plug-in including WAV and Ogg-Vorbis
  playback
  silently ignored it. This caused the sound to depend on the encoding and to
  change within playlists. A bad thing.</p>
<p>I recommend to use the powerful <a href="realeq.html">RealEQ plug-in</a> as an alternative.
  If you do not care about its precision use conservative setting like an FIR order of 4096.</p>
<p>If you do not like this alternative or it eats too much CPU for your purposes,
  you have to wait for a parametric EQ plug-in which uses very fast IIR filters.
  This will require nearly no CPU cycles and work with any source although.
  However, one must do the job.</p>

<h3>Playlist windows</h3>
<img src="images/playlist.png">
<p>Playlists, the playlist manager and bookmarks are now basically the same thing.
  Furthermore you can <strong>open multiple playlists</strong>. That means:</p>
<ul>
  <li>The <strong><a href="playlist.html">Playlist Window</a></strong> is now
    nothing more than a <strong>detailed view</strong> of a playlist.</li>
  <li>The <strong>playlist button</strong> will open the <strong>default playlist</strong>.</li>
  <li>The default playlist is used if you drop more than one object
        on the player.</li>
  <li>The <strong><a href="manager.html">Playlist Manager</a></strong> is a <strong>tree
      view</strong> of
    another default playlist, which usually contains other playlists, of course.</li>
  <li>The <strong><a herf="bookmark.html">bookmark editor</a></strong>
    is now a detailed view of a special playlist that is visualized in the player's context menu.</li>
  <li>You can use drag and drop and direct manipulation to modify all of the
    above.</li>
  <li>Different views of the same content are immediately synchronized as long
    they are part of the same PM123 instance.</li>
</ul>

<h4>Nested playlists</h4>
<p>Playlists may contain other playlists and they may contain further playlists
  and so on. This has the following effects:</p>
<ul>
  <li>All items of a child playlist are played when the playback
    reaches the sublist and before PM123 continues in the parent list.</li>
  <li>In shuffle mode items in different sublists are not interchanged.</li>
  <li>The PM123 main window flattens the nested lists and shows always the index
    and the time offsets within all Song items in the nested list structure.
    To see what's going on open a tree view of the currently played list
    ('<a href="mainmenu.html">Context menu</a>/Current Playlist/Show tree view'
    or simply 'Ctrl+T').</li>
  <li>Nested playlists in the bookmark list cause sub menus.</li>
  <li>When the playlists are nested recursively the player will ignore sublists
    that are already in the call stack. This avoids an infinite recursion.</li>
</ul>
<h4>File system folders</h4>
<p>PM123 is able to play the content of <a href="playfolder.html">file system folders</a> directly without the
  need to load all files into a playlist. This works as follows:</p>
<ul>
  <li>The content of a folder is handled as a <strong>virtual playlist</strong>.</li>
  <li>Optionally sub folders are virtualized as nested playlists too.</li>
  <li>Unplayable files are skipped during playback but shown in the folder views.</li>
  <li>Changes in the file system are reflected to PM123 when PM123 is restarted
    or a folder is manually refreshed.</li>
  <li>If a folder is selected in the open dialog or by drag and drop
    the content is no longer copied into a real playlist.</li>
</ul>
<p>This feature also changed the behavior when <b>dropping a folder</b> at PM123.
  The objects in the folder are no longer expanded immediately.
  Instead, they are read when the folder is actually played.
  This allows to reflect changes to the folder to PM123.
  See <a href="dragndrop.html">Drag &amp; Drop</a> for further details.<br>
  To get the old behavior add the folder to a <a href="playlist.html">playlist</a>
  and choose 'Flatten' from the <a href="playlist_cmi.html">context menu</a> of the folder.</p>
