<h2>Migrating to PM123 1.40</h2>
<p>There are some major changes in the GUI that you should be aware of when moving
  from an earlier version. For further information see the <a href="../History.txt">changelog</a>.</p>
<h3>Playlist windows</h3>
<img src="images/playlist.gif">
<p>Playlists, the playlist manager and bookmarks are now basically the same.
  Furthermore you can open multiple playlists. That means:</p>
<ul>
  <li>The <strong><a href="playlist.html">playlist window</a></strong> is now
    nothing more than a <strong>detailed view</strong> of a playlist.</li>
  <li>A default playlist is used if you drop more than one object
        on the player.</li>
  <li>The <strong><a href="manager.html">playlist manager</a></strong> is a <strong>tree
      view</strong> of
    another default playlist, which usually contains other playlists, of course.</li>
  <li>The <strong>bookmark editor</strong> is now a detailed view of a special
    playlist that is visualized in the player's context menu too.</li>
  <li>You can use drag and drop and direct manipulation to modify all of the
    above.</li>
  <li>Different views of the same content are immediately synchronized as long
    they are part of the same PM123 instance.</li>
</ul>

<h4>Nested playlists</h4>
<p>Playlists may contain other playlists and they may contain further playlists
  too. That has the following effects:</p>
<ul>
  <li>While playing all items of a child playlist are played when the playback
    reaches the sublist and before PM123 continues in the parent list.</li>
  <li>In shuffle mode items in different sublists are not interchanged.</li>
  <li>The PM123 main window flattens the nested lists and shows allways the index
    and the time offsets in the virtually flattened list. To see what's going
    on open a tree view of the currently played list.</li>
  <li>Nested playlists in the bookmark list cause submenus.</li>
  <li>When the playlists are nested recursively the play iterator will skip sublists
    that are already in the call stack. This avoids an infinite recursion.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Filesystem folders</h4>
<p>PM123 is able to play the content of filesystem folders directly without the
  need to load all files into a playlist. This works as follows:</p>
<ul>
  <li>The content of a folder is handled as a virtual playlist.</li>
  <li>Optionally subfolders are virtualized as nested playlists too.</li>
  <li>Unplayable files are skipped during playback.</li>
  <li>Changes in the filesystem are reflected to PM123 when PM123 is restarted
    or a folder is manually refreshed.</li>
  <li>If a folder is selected in the open dialog the content is no longer copied
    into a real playlist.</li>
  <li>You cannot modify virtual playlists.</li>
</ul>
