<h2>PM123's Playlist Manager</h2>
<p>Playlist Manager is provided for browsing and managing
playlists. In fact it is nothing else but a tree view of some default
playlist file. The Playlist Manager window will remember the objects
added to it next time you open it.
</p>
<p>If you open any other playlist in the tree view you have to
save the changes on your own. If the playlist is modified '<tt>(*)</tt>'
will show up in the window title. However, you won't see whether nested
playlists are modified. </p>
