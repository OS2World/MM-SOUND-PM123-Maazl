<b><font size=+2>PM123's Playlist Manager</font></b>
<p>Playlist Manager is provided for browsing and managing
playlists. Note that Playlist Manager <b>is not</b> a replacement for the
playlist. You can add and remove lists from Playlist Manager, load lists
into the normal playlist, load single files and calculate statistics. Also
note that some of Playlist Manager's options only work with .LST playlists saved
with PM123.
