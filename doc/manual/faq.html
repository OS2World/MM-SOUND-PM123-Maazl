<h2>PM123 FAQ</h2>
<h3><a name="hierarchical_bookmarks"></a>How to organize my Bookmarks
hierarchically?</h3>
<p>With PM123 1.40 the bookmarks in the context menu are no longer
flat. They may be organizes in sub menus like with a web browser.</p>
<ol>
  <li>Open the <a href="bookmark.html">Bookmarks window</a> as tree
view.</li>
  <li>Right click on the free space in the bookmarks area to open the <a
 href="playlist_cm.html">context menu</a> of the playlist.</li>
  <li>Select <i>Append.../new Playlist...</i></li>
  <li>Select an appropriate file location for your new bookmark
section. The file need not to exist.<i><br>
    </i></li>
  <li>Use drag and drop to move bookmarks into this new folder.</li>
</ol>
Nested playlists will automatically show up as sub menus in the
bookmark list.<br>
<h3><a name="internet_radio_list"></a>How do I manage Internet Radio
Stations?</h3>
<p>The recommended way is to <em>use a playlist</em>. Put the URLs
of the
Internet Radio Stations into this playlist. While playing a stream of
this playlist <em>the </em><em>previous/</em><em>next buttons change
the program</em>. </p>
<p>Since an internet stream usually does not end the playlist is
never played as sequence of songs. Instead the current stream keeps
playing until you force another one to load.</p>
<h3><a name="alternation_lists"></a>How to deal with playlists of
Internet Radio Stations with
alternate server URLs?</h3>
<ol>
  <li>Put the playlist URL of the web site into your playlist with
internet radio stations.</li>
  <li>Open the context menu of the new entry from your local
playlist
and chose <i>Properties</i> (Alt-Enter).</li>
  <li>Check the box <i>Alternation list</i>.</li>
  <li>Set either <i>clear shuffle</i> or <i>force shuffle</i> (see
below).</li>
</ol>
<p>This will take the whole playlist as one item. So using
previous/next does not propagate to the next entry in this playlist,
but leave the sub list and continue in the parent playlist.</p>
<p><i>Clear shuffle</i> enforce PM123 to play the first valid item in
the list of URLs although if the shuffle button is pressed in the main
window.<br>
<i>Force shuffle</i> causes PM123 always to take a random entry from
the list of streams. This is effectively causes load balancing.<br>
If in doubt chose <i>clear shuffle</i>.</p>
