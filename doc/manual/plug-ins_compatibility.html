plug-in</a> (<tt>fade.dll</tt>)</td>
      <td bgcolor="#ffdddd">The plug-in loads as expected,
but does
not do it's job anymore. Most likely because it makes assumptions about
undocumented properties of older PM123 versions.<br>
The new plug-in interface features of PM123 1.40 should allow to write
a more sophisticated solution using a filter plug-in. However, somebody
has to do the job. But since PM123 1.40 supports gap-less playback out
of the box, it is no longer that important.</td>

plug-in</a> (<tt>normal.dll</tt>, <tt>normhelp.dll</tt>)</td>
      <td bgcolor="#ffdddd">Will not work because it
utilizes the visual plug-in interface which has changed with PM123 1.32.<br>
It also is superseded by the built-in Replay-Gain handling since
1.32rc1.</td>

when the playback starts, mostly on the 2nd usage. Reason unknown.
Looks like undefined behavior because

source
available.</td>

PM123 1.32rc1 a
Ogg-Vorbis plug-in is included anyway. Unfortunately it has the same
name. But it is entirely different and superior.</td>

<p><u>Note:</u> When loading older decoder plug-ins
you might want to add some extended attributes file types&nbsp;to
the
plug-in in the properties dialog. This enables you to play files
without the standard extensions.</p>
