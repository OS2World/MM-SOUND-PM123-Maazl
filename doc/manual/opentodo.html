a playlist with a set of alternative streaming servers instead of a
single server. While PM123 is able to handle this kind of files and
play the first valid stream, it has unwanted effects when adding these
playlists to another playlist, because all of the contained items are
equivalent.</td>

preserve additional file properties.</td>

replaces the original file by this copy.
This is reliable but it discards any information that OS/2 cannot see
like access rights on a remote host
or hard links to the file. There should be an in-place option to work
around this.</td>
