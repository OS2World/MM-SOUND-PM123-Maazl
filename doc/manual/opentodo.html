<h2>PM123's Known Problems &amp; Todo list</h2>
<table border="1" cellpadding="3" cellspacing="0">

<tr align="left" bgcolor="#cccccc">
<th>Attributes</th>
<th width="25%">Topic</th>
<th width="55%">Details</th>
</tr>
<tr class="open">
<td><strong>1 major todo, open</strong></td>
<td>Shuffle not working</td>
<td>There are some open issues how this should work with
respect to nested playlists and the previous/next buttons when the
playlist is modified.</td>
</tr>
<tr class="test">
<td>3 minor todo, untested</td>
<td>Handling of start and stop positions in nested playlists</td>
<td>There are several complications when start/stop
iterators of nested playlists have conflicting settings.</td>
</tr>
<tr class="open">
<td><em>5 medium bug, open</em></td>
<td>Decoder starts at wrong priority</td>
<td>In playlist mode when the data for the next song is
prefetched the new decoder thread does not inherit the priority from
the old thread. This may cause the playback to have drop outs.</td>
</tr>
<tr class="open">
<td><em>6 medium bug, open</em></td>
<td>Deadlocks with recursive playlists</td>
<td>With recursive playlist structures PM123 sometimes
deadlocks because the list semaphore are not requested top down. In
fact there is no top and no bottom in this case.<br>
The problem arises from PlayableCollection::GetCollectionInfo.
The required information is prefetched, but that is not sufficient.
If another worker thread is working on another information of the other
item and is demanding information from the current item in the same
way,
everything stops.<br>
I think a conditional variable for each object in CollectionInfoCache
is the only solution.</td>
</tr>
<tr class="open">
<td><em>11 medium bug, open</em></td>
<td>NavigateTo does not work if we see a slice of the
current root.</td>
<td>If the currently visible windows root is below the
currently loaded root, navigate to starts at the loaded root rather
than the window's root. This consequently fails.</td>
</tr>
<tr class="open">
<td>12 minor bug, open</td>
<td>Glitches of the slider when seeking or starting at a
certain location.</td>
<td>When playback starts at a non-zero starting point the
slider jumps to zero for the time of the initialization.</td>
</tr>
<tr class="test">
<td><em>13 medium todo, untested</em></td>
<td>M3U8 support</td>
<td>PM123 1.32 also support Unicode playlist files. This
has to be ported.</td>
</tr>
<tr class="open">
<td>14 minor todo, open</td>
<td>Feature: continue playing when loading an enclosing
playlist.</td>
<td>If the currently playing item is part of the actually
loaded playlist, playing should not be aborted. This is a configuration
option.</td>
</tr>
<tr class="open">
<td>15 minor todo, open</td>
<td>playlist with alternative items for HTTP streams</td>
<td>For live streams&nbsp;it is quite common to provide
a playlist with a set of alternative streaming servers instead of a
single server. While PM123 is able to handle this kind of files and
play the first valid stream, it has unwanted effects when adding these
playlists to another playlist, because all of the contained items are
equivalent.</td>
</tr>
<tr class="open">
<td>17 minor todo, open</td>
<td>Write ID3 tags and vorbis comments always in place to
preserve additional file properties.</td>
<td>Currently PM123 creates a copy of the file and then
replaces the original file by this copy.
This is reliable but it discards any information that OS/2 cannot see
like access rights on a remote host
or hard links to the file. There should be an in-place option to work
around this.</td>
</tr>
<tr class="open">
<td><em>18 medium todo, in work</em></td>
<td>The command line interface and the remote interface
needs to be reworked and tested.</td>
<td>The many changes to PM123 are not fully reflected to
the remote interface so far.</td>
</tr>
<tr class="open">
<td>20 minor todo, open</td>
<td>ogg123: support padding of vorbis comments</td>
<td>Newer
libvorbis can change vorbis comments in place. ogg123 should use this
to avoid unnecessary file replacements. This may supersede #17.</td>
</tr>
<tr class="open">
<td>21 medium bug, open</td>
<td>Dropping a folder to PM123 program object does not work.</td>
<td>When invoking PM123 with a folder as command line
argument
no trailing slash is added automatically. Consequently the playback
fails
with 'no matching decoder'.</td>
</tr>
<tr class="open">
<td>22 minor bug, open</td>
<td>Time display is sometimes jumpy and not monotonous.</td>
<td>The function output_playing_pos of os2audio.dll does
not always hit the nail on the head. Reason unknown.</td>
</tr>
<tr class="open">
<td><em>23 medium bug, open</em></td>
<td>Pipe interface not working</td>
<td>Open tagedit ... does not work. The command line with * splits the commands into seperate ones.</td>
</tr>
