current root.</td>

currently loaded root, navigate to starts at the loaded root rather
than the window's root. This consequently fails.</td>

      <td>For live streams&nbsp;it is quite common to provide
a playlist with a set of alternative streaming servers instead of a
single server. While PM123 is able to handle this kind of files and
play the first valid stream, it has unwanted effects when adding these
playlists to another playlist, because all of the contained items are
equivalent.</td>

preserve additional file properties.</td>
      <td>Currently PM123 creates a copy of the file and then
replaces the original file by this copy.
This is reliable but it discards any information that OS/2 cannot see
like access rights on a remote host
or hard links to the file. There should be an in-place option to work
around this.</td>

libvorbis can change vorbis comments in place. ogg123 should use this
to avoid unnecessary file replacements. This may supersede #17.</td>

argument
no trailing slash is added automatically. Consequently the playback
fails

data strings can be quite long. This can cause the scroller to take a
reasonable amount of time to return to the start. An option to restrict
the length of the meta data for the scroller display would be helpful.</td>
