<h2>Compatibility of PM123 1.40 with earlier versions</h2>
<h3>Playlist files</h3>
<p>PM123 1.40 stores a bunch of additional properties to playlist
entries. These entries are ignored by PM123 1.32. But if you edit and
save the playlist with a previous version <em>the following properties of
PM123 1.40 maybe lost</em>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Alias name</li>
<li>Start- and Stop position</li>
</ul>
<h3>Profiles and working directory</h3>
<p>PM123 1.40 will read or convert most of the settings from earlier
versions. But some information is stored in a way that earlier versions
can no longer read it. They are:</p>
<ul>
<li>The list of loaded plug-ins</li>
<li>The bookmark names</li>
</ul><p><em>It is not recommended to share configuration files between different program versions.</em></p>
<h3>Running two versions simultaneously</h3>
<p>Different versions of PM123 use DLLs with the same name. Since
OS/2 by default will not load a DLL when some other one with the same
name is already in memory, this will usually result in a crash of the
secondly started PM123 instance.</p>
<p>To work around this problem use <strong><tt>SET
LIBPATHSTRICT=T</tt></strong>
before you start any of the PM123 instances.</p><h3>Drag and Drop</h3><p>Using
Drag and Drop to drag playlist items between windows of
different PM123 versions results in undefined behavior. Most likely one
of the applications will crash. The machine's user interface may also
completely lock up, because OS/2 really dislikes crashes during Drag and
Drop.</p>
