3. KNOWN ISSUES

   Bugs
   ----
      - the proxy feature in mpg123 and cddaplay does not work well
      - the GUI freezes in various places due to network access and the need
        of threads for such operations
      - some valid bitrates are not displayed in the icons of the skin
      - pm123 runs as a real-time process, so it can freeze OS/2 if the CPU
        is too slow: be careful!
      - there still might be occasional redraw problems where pm123 plagues
        the whole screen, not just pm123's windows
      - various windows always appear only at the bottom left of the screen

   Missing Features
   ----------------
      - continuous playback would be nice
      - the genre list is not editable
      - no support for ID3v2
      - the way the scroller scrolls is annoying for some people:
        need of a "wrap around scroller"
      - the "remote control" pipe does not report if pm123 is playing or not
        (example: a "echo *status > \pipe\pm123" returning
                    "stopped", "paused" or "playing" would be nice)
      - Ogg, FLAC, etc support... a generic plug-in that could use command
        line decoders would also be nice
      - drag & drop skin would be nice
      - no support for "new" WinAmp 2.x or 3.x skins, only old ones for
        WinAmp 1.x
      - load all files from playlist file before loading information from
        each file would be nice
      - a "double size" would be nice
      - automatic fade in / fade out would be nice
      - add a status bar in the playlist window
      - no transparent or non-square skins because too difficult and
        ineffecient in OS/2
      - cannot load a CD track from command line
      - no history for the "Load URL" dialog
      - should load WinAmp skin directly instead of using a converter
      - no way to display customized information from each song in the
        playlist window or main window
      - when loading an MP3 stream, there is no feedback when the buffer is
        filling up
      - no sound balance control
      - no skin for the equalizer, playlist, etc windows
