<h2>PM123's History</h2>
<h3>PM123 1.40 (beta 1)</h3>
<ul>
<li>Standard equalizer removed. This one was supported by mpg123 only so it makes no sense
    in the PM123 core.
<li>Gapless playback in playlist mode.
    Subsequent songs are prefetched before the current song has finally ended.
    The output and the filter plug-ins are no longer reinitialized between the
    songs.
<li>Navigation across song borders. A seek in playlist mode will restore the
    previous song if that changed meanwhile.
<li>Scanning across song borders. A forward or rewind will no longer stop at song borders.
<li>Retain playing position on player exit/restart.
<li>Added queue mode that automatically discards played items from the default playlist.<br>
    Furthermore you may append dropped or double-clicked items to the default playlist
    instead of loading them immediately.
<li>Playlists, Playlist manager, Bookmarks are now basically the same.
    This offers <em>plenty much of new features</em>.
<li>Support for nested playlists.
    Playlists may be nested as deep as you like.
<li>Properly handling of recursions in nested playlists.
<li>Support for directories. PM123 no longer needs to expand the folder content
    at the moment where a folder is dropped to the player or a playlist.
<li>Added song and playlist slicing. A playlist entry may now only reference a part
    of a song or another playlist.
<li>Added support for bookmarks with current playling position.
<li>Added support for bookmarks to playlists and playlist items.
<li>Configure the name of the remote pipe to control more than one active player instance.  
<li>Moved the ID3 tag editor to MPG123. Consequently the related setting are
    now in the plug-ins configure dialog.
<li>Decoder plug-ins may extend the Load/Add context menu.
    Moved the load track function into the CDDAPLAY plug-in.
<li>New plug-in interface with much more flexibility to buffer handling and
    filter plug-ins.
<li>The new plug-in manager checks whether the PM123/plug-in pair is known to
    work. It can load all old plug-ins except for visual plug-ins throgh an
    virtualization layer.
<li>Changed the internal data structures to use always 16 bits per sample to
    reduce complexity of code and plug-ins.
</ul>
<blockquote>
<h4>REALEQ</h4>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Realeq does no longer delay the playback and cut the last samples.
    It operates now as virtually zero-phase filter.
<li>Enabling/disabling the EQ does no longer cause the playback to jump.
<li>Changing the FIR order does no longer cause major glitches.
<li>The maximum FIR order is now 16384, giving very accurate results.
    The maximum FFT size is now 32768.
<li>The MMX and ordinary convolution is finally removed. Both are outperformed by
    the new FFT convolution. This will cause <em>low CPU usage</em> even
    with large FIR orders.
<li>Save the slider settings by value in REALEQ.INI. Now the restore do no
    longer depend on the last loaded file and changes to the loaded settings
    are kept after restart.
<li>Added master gain and mute controls.
<li>Added group delay equalization.
<li>Scale FFT plansize and FIR order with the sampling rate.
</ul>
<blockquote>

    (Message: "Blocktype == 0 and window-switching == 1 not allowed.")
<li>The decoder now understand Relative volume adjustment (RVA2) field
    of the ID3v2 tag. Therefore Andreas Schosser normalize plug-in is
    not needed anymore. Configure DART Output plug-in and welcome!
</ul>
</ul>
<blockquote>

    also much faster than it was in beta 2. Use "Random" in the Sort submenu
    if you want to do playlist shuffling.
<li>Repeat and Random playback state are now reloaded after launch.
<li>Fixed random crash when adding with recurse, I hope...

<li>Adding to a playlist before the current loaded song now updates its index.
<li>Deleting from a playlist before the current loaded song now also updates
    its index.
<li>Directories can now be added from the "Add to list" file dialog.
    This is basically a hack in the file dialog. Unless you manually type
    the path, the directory will have to be selected in the directory listbox
    AND it must be the current directory listed in the file listbox AND
    the filename entry field must be empty, or "*" or the default "*.*".
<li>HUGE playlist (~900 songs and more) are now able to load.
<li>pm123 doesn't crash when loading playlist from the command line
    for an already opened instance.  This includes .m3u since they are

    not just the one with the same exact filename.  but this basically
    makes it faster...
<li>Added support for WinAmp style .pls playlist files including SHOUTcast.
    Titles for SHOUTcast servers are loaded from the .pls so you see all
    the neat stuff like the load of the servers when you load the playlist.
<li>Fixed problem loading HTTP URLs with no path like on SHOUTcast.
<li>Included procedure in netscape.html to properly configure pm123 as a
    Netscape Navigator helper application.
<li>Fixed memory leak when removing entries from the playlist.
<li>Streaming buffer now works properly and continues playing buffered
    stream even if read operations are stalled.
<li>Broken HTTP connections are now properly canceled and closed on stop.
<li>Added workaround for timing problem in DART for setting volume right
    after the device is opened.
<li>HTTP URL with no filename like SHOUTcast now show the complete host
    instead of interpreting it as a filename. Title streaming is on its
    way...
</ul>

<h4>MPG123</h4>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Fixed streaming audio by adding two in a row header checking.
<li>Implements new pm123 decoder plug-in interface.
<li>Fixed floating point exception crashes.  Let me know if you can
    still reproduce any SYS3183.
<li>Fixed problem with MP3 EQ range calculation with low frequency
    overflowing table and screwing up memory when MPEG 2.5 Layer III files
    were played.
<li>Added support for virtual hostnames in HTTP123.DLL
<li>In HTTP123.DLL, fixed seeking (and also loading) problems and glitches,
    especially with slow media (like CD-ROMs) and big read buffers.  But be
    wise, Read Ahead buffering produces an unnecessary overhead on fast
    media.
<li>Added mp3->wav decoder.  Command line utility only for now.
<li>For developers, added a play status semaphore.  It can be used to sleep
    instead of DosSleep() with the advantage of knowing exactly when the
    player stops.
<li>Fixed MMPM crash when DART underrun occurs.
<li>Fixed Equalizer mute crash.
<li>FileInfo (in playlist) was always reporting 0 length songs.
<li>Fixed possible infinite loop in read ahead header.
<li>Added support for Xing Variable Bitrate MP3s.
<li>Added auto-repause kludge so that when MMOS/2 gives access back to the
    sound device, the bug in MMOS/2 doesn't unpause mpg123.
<li>Added new 10 bands ISO normal frequency equalizer for MP3s *only*.  The
    interface (which also needs to be fixed) will not be updated until
    Taneli has more time on his hands, but here are the bands.  Also note
    that the decibel calculation was wrong before (way too loud).
<li>12kHz MPEG 2.5 Layer 3 files now play.
<li>Added fix for new Xing encoded MP3s from mpg123 0.59q
<li>Added read ahead header check.  This should make ALL valid MP3s even
    with borked headers work, and should not identify anything else than
    MPEG audio files as MPEG audio files such as bitmaps lying around in
    your MP3 directories.
<li>Added fix for Aurora from dink.
<li>oops, broke some MP3s for nothing, it's back all right now
<li>play 48 at 44 works right now
<li>found some Audio MPEG Header documentation.  Should now work with any
    MP3s other players or decoders play, if not, please contact me.  I've
    also fixed 8000Hz MP3 support, cool.
<li>patched possible divide by zero when loading corrupted files.
<li>implemented workaround for bad GUS driver DART buffer timing (it jumps by
    250 ms step once in a while instead of incrementing for each buffer).
    Makes decoderPlayingSamples() work correctly on GUS.
<li>finally found the proper buffers to flush.  no more first buffer trash
    kludge and now any snap crackle and pop are REALLY only coming from your
    sound card alone (check the visual plugins if you don't believe me)
<li>faster seek by boosting priority (oops, forgot this initially :)
<li>audio engine now fills empty buffers with 128 value instead of 0 for 8
    bit playback (removes the clicks, but it still sounds like shit :).
</ul>

<h3>PM123 1.01</h3>
<ul>
<li>Fixed bug in WinAmp skin loading that caused PM123 to crash
<li>Fixed a WinAmp skin seek slider glitch - please reconvert
    your seek slider problematic skins

<li>Fixed font bug in older skins
<li>Fixed a bug in the Unregistered window which caused it to hover
    above all windows
<li>Fixed bug when pressing Alt-F4 in the main window

    which can be activated by starting PM123 with the "-smooth" switch
<li>Improved 256-color support
<li>Shift-click Play/Stop button while playing to fade out and stop playing
</ul>
<blockquote>
<h4>MPG123</h4>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li>fixed timing bug between MP123_PLAY and MP123_STOP
<li>added buffer mode to HTTP123.DLL and in MPG123.DLL.  rewing and fast
    forward will give a quirk in buffer mode sometimes.
</ul>

<h3>PM123 1.0</h3>
<ul>
<li>Improved skin handling (making it possible to make PM123 look
    almost 1:1 with WinAmp)
<li>Improved palette handling
<li>Fixed WarpAMP playlist loading
<li>Fixed drag'n'drop playlist reorganizing

<li>Added graphical equalizer with band mute and preamplifier
<li>Improved HTTP handling
<li>Added M3U support in playlist
<li>Spectrum analyzer, CPU usage and oscilloscope plugin
<li>Real Equalizer
</ul>
<blockquote>
<h4>MPG123</h4>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li>decoderFileInfo can now be called more than once at the same time
<li>kludged the jump to command to trash the first buffer (until I figure out
    more on the digital audio processing and where it keeps the buffer)
<li>enlarged filename length from ~512 to ~1024, allows for bigger URL I
    guess.
<li>now compiled with VAC++, works better with DLLs than EMX
<li>RxDecoderError now works
<li>decoderError now reports non-critical errors
<li>decoderError now queues error messages, empty it, or you'll memory leak
<li>added filter plugins
<li>added possibility to change the decoder's band gain (there are only 32
    linear bands, at the moment, this means at a sample rate of 44100, ~689Hz
    per band = 44100/2/32) they suck BTW
<li>added decoderPlayingSamples, to catch a few samples realtime from the
    OS/2 DART audio system to display real time stuff like an oscilloscope
    or a spectrum analyzer.  Note, it will get a buffer length in bytes, you
    have to calculate how many of them you need according to the
    bitspersample and channels.
<li>decoderFileInfo now reports 0 on success and some error code otherwize.
<li>decoderPlaying extention as decoderStatus
<li>new kludge that plays 48kHz PCM at 44.1kHz.  This is really ugly, you
    don't hear a big difference, but you're better off converting it.  If you
    are wondering why I'm not converting it realtime 1. more CPU time needed
    *OR* 2. sounds real bad (aliasing and company)
<li>HTTP module now in HTTP.DLL
</uL>

<h3>PM123 pre 1.0 Beta 2</h3>
<ul>
<li>Added keyboard shortcuts:<br>
    * Left/Right = Rewind/Fast Forward<br>
    * Enter = Play/Stop<br>
    * 5 (on numeric keypad) = Pause<br>
    * Up/Down = Next/Previous song<br>
    * Alt F4 = Quit<br>
    * +/- = Increase/Decrease volume
<li>Added skin support
<li>Fixed shuffle
<li>Fixed RIFF headered and/or broken MP3 support
<li>Added seek slider (grab seek slider to move within MP3)
<li>Fixed control button errors
<li>Enhanced/fixed tag editor
<li>WarpAMP playlist loading
</ul>
<blockquote>
<h4>MPG123</h4>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li>decoderTime(PLAYEDSECS) now shows the position being played, not decoded.
<li>when buffers are trashed for rew and ffwd, the mpeg stream file position
    is brought to the file position that the decoder was at when it filled
    the currently playing audio buffer.
<li>the decoderTime(TOTALSECS) now reports something until all audio buffers
    are played.
<li>max buffers locked to 200 and min to 5. these are 16KB buffers, and they
    seem like absolute limits anyway.
<li>fix crash when there was an MCI error when starting playing and pm123
    already played something before (trying to free memory it didn't
    allocate)
<li>the first buffer is trashed to prevent the playing of the last buffer of
    the previous stream (I can't figure out what's going on, help me!!!)
    Whatever snaps, crackles and pops left are due to your MPEG streams
    or your sound card.
<li>new decoderFileInfo().  allows program that need to check validity or
    specs of an mpeg stream with mpg123
<li>stop now unpauses the stream before closing.
<li>opening http streams should work better now.
<li>much better rewind and fast forward (makes jumptosecs work a lot better
    too)
<li>reporting errors should be more reliable
<li>http routines now report usable error messages
<li>http routines now check for "Content-Length" to determine total time
<li>seeking and timer routines now use the file position instead of keeping
    track of the frame numbers.  makes the decoder faster and more consistent
    with the total time.
<li>added REXX support ... hum
