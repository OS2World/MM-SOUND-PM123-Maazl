Welcome!
<p>
PM123 is a high-quality digital audio player for IBM's OS/2 Warp
operating system. You can play MP3s, WAV-files and even audio CDs. PM123
supports skins, audio streaming, plug-ins, visualization, CDDB and more!
<p>
<ol>
<li>INSTALLATION
   <p>
   If you have not used the WarpIN package to install this software, use
   makewps.cmd to create WPS Desktop objects for PM123.
   <p>
   If you install this package over the PM123 version less than 1.32, you
   need to add manually oggplay.dll to the list of decoders using PM123
   properties dialog.

<li>KNOWN ISSUES
   <p> 
   Bugs
   <ul>
   <li>the GUI freezes in various places due to network access and the need
       of threads for such operations.
   <li>there still might be occasional redraw problems where pm123 plagues
       the whole screen, not just pm123's windows.
   </ul>
   <p>
   Missing Features
   <ul>
   <li>continuous playback would be nice
   <li>the genre list is not editable
   <li>the way the scroller scrolls is annoying for some people:
       need of a "wrap around scroller"
   <li>the "remote control" pipe does not report if pm123 is playing or not
       (example: a "echo *status > \pipe\pm123" returning "stopped", "paused" 
       or "playing" would be nice)
   <li>FLAC, etc support... a generic plug-in that could use command
       line decoders would also be nice
   <li>drag & drop skin would be nice
   <li>no support for "new" WinAmp 2.x or 3.x skins, only old ones for
       WinAmp 1.x
   <li>load all files from playlist file before loading information from
       each file would be nice
   <li>a "double size" would be nice
   <li>automatic fade in / fade out would be nice
   <li>add a status bar in the playlist window
   <li>no transparent or non-square skins because too difficult and
       ineffecient in OS/2
   <li>no history for the "Load URL" dialog
   <li>should load WinAmp skin directly instead of using a converter
   <li>no way to display customized information from each song in the
       playlist window or main window
   <li>when loading an MP3 stream, there is no feedback when the buffer is
       filling up
   <li>no sound balance control
   <li>no skin for the equalizer, playlist, etc windows
   </ul>

   <dd>Vorbis is a general purpose audio and music encoding format
       contemporary to MPEG-4's AAC and TwinVQ, the next generation beyond
       MPEG audio layer 3. Unlike the MPEG sponsored formats (and other
       proprietary formats such as RealAudio G2 and Windows' flavor of the
       month), the Vorbis CODEC specification belongs to the public domain.
       All the technical details are published and documented, and any
       software entity may make full use of the format without license 
       fee, royalty or patent concerns. Written by  Monty <monty@xiph.org>
