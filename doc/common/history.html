      <li>Standard equalizer removed. This one was supported by mpg123 only, so
        it makes no sense in the PM123 core.</li>
      <li><em>Gap-less playback</em> in playlist mode. Subsequent songs are
        prefetched before the current song has finally ended. The output and the
        filter plug-ins are no longer reinitialized between the songs.</li>
      <li>Navigation across song borders. A seek in playlist mode will restore
        the previous song if that changed meanwhile.</li>
      <li>Scanning across song borders. A forward or rewind will no longer stop
        at song borders.</li>
      <li>Optionally retain playing position on player exit/restart.</li>
      <li>Added queue mode that automatically discards played items from the
        default playlist.<br>
        Furthermore you may append dropped or double-clicked items to the
        default playlist instead of loading them immediately.</li>
      <li>Playlists, Playlist manager, Bookmarks are now basically the same
        thing. This offers <i>plenty much of new features</i>.</li>
      <li>Support for <em>nested playlists</em>. Playlists may be nested as
        deep as you like. This allows structured bookmarks too.</li>
      <li>Properly handling of recursions in nested playlists.</li>
      <li>Support for directories. PM123 no longer needs to expand the folder
        content at the moment where a folder is dropped to the player or a
        playlist.</li>
      <li>Added <em>song and playlist slicing</em>. A playlist entry may now
        reference only a part of a song or another playlist.</li>
      <li>Added support for bookmarks with current playing position.</li>
      <li>Added support for bookmarks to playlists and playlist items.</li>
      <li>Asynchronous workers for dealing with network timeouts or large
        playlists without locking the user interface.</li>
      <li>Configure the name of the remote pipe to control more than one active
        player instance.</li>
      <li>Moved the ID3 tag editor to MPG123. Consequently the related settings
        are now in the plug-ins configure dialog.</li>
      <li>Decoder plug-ins may extend the Load/Add context menu. Moved the load
        track function into the CDDAPLAY plug-in.</li>
      <li>New plug-in interface with much more flexibility to buffer handling
        and filter plug-ins.</li>
      <li>The new plug-in manager checks whether the PM123/plug-in pair is known
        to work. It can load all old plug-ins except for visual plug-ins through
        an virtualization layer.</li>
      <li>Changed the internal data structures to use always 16 bits per sample
        to reduce complexity of code and plug-ins.</li>
      <li>Ported resizable file dialog from PM123 1.33.</li>
      <li>Now it is possible to control the wait period in seconds when a new
        stream connection is requested. (Port from PM123 1.33).</li>
      <li>Wrap around scroller.</li>
      <li>XIO123: properly handling of TCP/IP receive timeouts.</li>
    </ul>
    <blockquote>
      <h4>REALEQ</h4>
    </blockquote>
    <ul>
      <li>Realeq does no longer delay the playback and cut the last samples. It
        operates now as virtually zero-phase filter.</li>
      <li>Enabling/disabling the EQ does no longer cause the playback to jump.</li>
      <li>Changing the FIR order does no longer cause major glitches.</li>
      <li>The maximum FIR order is now 16384, giving very accurate results. The
        maximum FFT size is now 32768.</li>
      <li>The MMX and ordinary convolution is finally removed. Both are
        outperformed by far by the new FFT convolution. This will cause <em>low
          CPU usage</em> even with large FIR orders.</li>
      <li>Save the slider settings by value in REALEQ.INI. Now the restore do no
        longer depend on the last loaded file and changes to the loaded settings
        are kept after restart.</li>
      <li>Added master gain and mute controls.</li>
      <li>Added <em>group delay equalization</em>.</li>
      <li>Scale FFT plan size and FIR order with the sampling rate.</li>
    </ul>

      <li>Sort Genres by name.</li>
      <li>Fix: continue playing on side info error. (Message: "Blocktype == 0
        and window-switching == 1 not allowed.")</li>
      <li>The decoder now understand Relative Volume Adjustment (RVA2) field of
        the ID3v2 tag. Therefore Andreas Schosser normalize plug-in is not
        needed anymore. Configure DART Output plug-in and welcome!</li>
      <li>Removed force 8 bit option.</li>

    <blockquote>
      <h4>MPG123</h4>
    </blockquote>
    <ul>
      <li>Improved support of VBR mp3 files having a correct VBR header. Also
        improved support of VBR files without such header: timers and length of
        a song can be wrong, but there are no jerks of the seek slider.</li>

      <li>Fixed floating point exception crashes. Let me know if you can still
        reproduce any SYS3183.</li>
      <li>Fixed problem with MP3 EQ range calculation with low frequency
        overflowing table and screwing up memory when MPEG 2.5 Layer III files
        were played.</li>
      <li>Added support for virtual host names in HTTP123.DLL</li>
      <li>In HTTP123.DLL, fixed seeking (and also loading) problems and
        glitches, especially with slow media (like CD-ROMs) and big read
        buffers. But be wise, Read Ahead buffering produces an unnecessary
        overhead on fast media.</li>
      <li>Added mp3-&gt;wav decoder. Command line utility only for now.</li>
      <li>For developers, added a play status semaphore. It can be used to sleep
        instead of DosSleep() with the advantage of knowing exactly when the

        sound device, the bug in MMOS/2 doesn't unpause mpg123.</li>
      <li>Added new 10 bands ISO normal frequency equalizer for MP3s *only*. The
        interface (which also needs to be fixed) will not be updated until
        Taneli has more time on his hands, but here are the bands. Also note
        that the decibel calculation was wrong before (way too loud).</li>
      <li>12kHz MPEG 2.5 Layer 3 files now play.</li>
      <li>Added fix for new Xing encoded MP3s from mpg123 0.59q</li>
      <li>Added read ahead header check. This should make ALL valid MP3s even
        with broken headers work, and should not identify anything else than
        MPEG audio files as MPEG audio files such as bitmaps lying around in
        your MP3 directories.</li>
      <li>Added fix for Aurora from dink.</li>
      <li>oops, broke some MP3s for nothing, it's back all right now</li>
      <li>play 48 at 44 works right now</li>
      <li>found some Audio MPEG Header documentation. Should now work with any
        MP3s other players or decoders play, if not, please contact me. I've
        also fixed 8000Hz MP3 support, cool.</li>
      <li>patched possible divide by zero when loading corrupted files.</li>
      <li>implemented workaround for bad GUS driver DART buffer timing (it jumps
        by 250 ms step once in a while instead of incrementing for each buffer).
        Makes decoderPlayingSamples() work correctly on GUS.</li>
      <li>finally found the proper buffers to flush. no more first buffer trash
        kludge and now any snap crackle and pop are REALLY only coming from your
        sound card alone (check the visual plug-ins if you don't believe me)</li>
      <li>faster seek by boosting priority (oops, forgot this initially :)</li>
      <li>audio engine now fills empty buffers with 128 value instead of 0 for 8
        bit playback (removes the clicks, but it still sounds like shit :).</li>
    </ul>

      <li>fixed timing bug between MP123_PLAY and MP123_STOP</li>
      <li>added buffer mode to HTTP123.DLL and in MPG123.DLL. rewinding and fast

    </blockquote>
    <ul>
      <li>decoderFileInfo can now be called more than once at the same time</li>
      <li>kludged the jump to command to trash the first buffer (until I figure
        out more on the digital audio processing and where it keeps the buffer)</li>
      <li>enlarged filename length from ~512 to ~1024, allows for bigger URL I
        guess.</li>
      <li>now compiled with VAC++, works better with DLLs than EMX</li>
      <li>RxDecoderError now works</li>
      <li>decoderError now reports non-critical errors</li>
      <li>decoderError now queues error messages, empty it, or you'll memory
        leak</li>
      <li>added filter plug-ins</li>
      <li>added possibility to change the decoder's band gain (there are only 32
        linear bands, at the moment, this means at a sample rate of 44100,
        ~689Hz per band = 44100/2/32) they suck BTW</li>
      <li>added decoderPlayingSamples, to catch a few samples real time from the
        OS/2 DART audio system to display real time stuff like an oscilloscope
        or a spectrum analyzer. Note, it will get a buffer length in bytes, you
        have to calculate how many of them you need according to the
        bitspersample and channels.</li>
      <li>decoderFileInfo now reports 0 on success and some error code
        otherwise.</li>
      <li>decoderPlaying extension as decoderStatus</li>
      <li>new kludge that plays 48kHz PCM at 44.1kHz. This is really ugly, you
        don't hear a big difference, but you're better off converting it. If you
        are wondering why I'm not converting it real time 1. more CPU time
        needed *OR* 2. sounds real bad (aliasing and company)</li>
      <li>HTTP module now in HTTP.DLL</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>PM123 pre 1.0 Beta 2</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Added keyboard shortcuts:<br>
        * Left/Right = Rewind/Fast Forward<br>
        * Enter = Play/Stop<br>
        * 5 (on numeric keypad) = Pause<br>
        * Up/Down = Next/Previous song<br>
        * Alt F4 = Quit<br>
        * +/- = Increase/Decrease volume</li>
      <li>Added skin support</li>
      <li>Fixed shuffle</li>
      <li>Fixed RIFF headered and/or broken MP3 support</li>
      <li>Added seek slider (grab seek slider to move within MP3)</li>
      <li>Fixed control button errors</li>
      <li>Enhanced/fixed tag editor</li>
      <li>WarpAMP playlist loading</li>

    <ul>
      <li>decoderTime(PLAYEDSECS) now shows the position being played, not
        decoded.</li>
      <li>when buffers are trashed for rew and ffwd, the mpeg stream file
        position is brought to the file position that the decoder was at when it
        filled the currently playing audio buffer.</li>
      <li>the decoderTime(TOTALSECS) now reports something until all audio
        buffers are played.</li>
      <li>max buffers locked to 200 and min to 5. these are 16KB buffers, and
        they seem like absolute limits anyway.</li>
      <li>fix crash when there was an MCI error when starting playing and pm123
        already played something before (trying to free memory it didn't
        allocate)</li>
      <li>the first buffer is trashed to prevent the playing of the last buffer
        of the previous stream (I can't figure out what's going on, help me!!!)
        Whatever snaps, crackles and pops left are due to your MPEG streams or
        your sound card.</li>
      <li>new decoderFileInfo(). allows program that need to check validity or
        specs of an mpeg stream with mpg123</li>
      <li>stop now unpauses the stream before closing.</li>
      <li>opening http streams should work better now.</li>
      <li>much better rewind and fast forward (makes jumptosecs work a lot
        better too)</li>
      <li>reporting errors should be more reliable</li>
      <li>http routines now report usable error messages</li>
      <li>http routines now check for "Content-Length" to determine total time</li>
      <li>seeking and timer routines now use the file position instead of
        keeping track of the frame numbers. makes the decoder faster and more
        consistent with the total time.</li>
      <li>added REXX support ... hum</li>
