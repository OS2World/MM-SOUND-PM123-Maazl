respect to nested playlists and the previous/next buttons when the
playlist is modified.</td>

      <td>PM123 sometimes crashes when starting playback</td>

violation at start of playback.<br>
Reason unknown. Perhaps some threading issue.<br>
Seems to have gone.</td>

      <td width="15%">3 minor todo, untested</td>
      <td>Handling of start and stop positions in nested playlists</td>

iterators of nested playlists have conflicting settings.</td>

non-existing show up. This messages should be suppressed.</td>

      <td>Decoder starts at wrong priority</td>
      <td>In playlist mode when the data for the next song is
prefetched the new decoder thread does not inherit the priority from
the old thread. This may cause the playback to have drop outs.<br>
Mainly fixed: the priority is fixed as soon as possible.</td>

playlists</td>

deadlocks because the list semaphore are not requested top down. In
fact there is no top and no bottom in this case.</td>

      <td>When an URL target is not available or invalid, it may
take several minutes for PM123 to notify this. If you have many of such
links e.g. in the bookmarks PM123 may be not responsive for a
considerable amount of time.<br>
This is a design problem, because any decoder plug-in might try to open
the URL without success, every time waiting for a timeout.</td>

tags are not turn around stable. This causes special characters to be
destroyed when saving the tag.</td>

gets information on a playlist.</td>

Can cause SIQ locks. Maybe the Worker should not lock the entire
playlist while calculation of tech infos.</td>

current root.</td>

currently loaded root, navigate to starts at the loaded root rather
than the window's root. This consequently fails.</td>

slider jumps to zero for the time of the initialization.</td>

      <td>For live streams&nbsp;it is quite common to provide
a playlist with a set of alternative streaming servers instead of a
single server. While PM123 is able to handle this kind of files and
play the first valid stream, it has unwanted effects when adding these
playlists to another playlist, because all of the contained items are
equivalent.</td>

preserve additional file properties.</td>
      <td>Currently PM123 creates a copy of the file and then
replaces the original file by this copy.
This is reliable but it discards any information that OS/2 cannot see
like access rights on a remote host
or hard links to the file. There should be an in-place option to work
around this.</td>
