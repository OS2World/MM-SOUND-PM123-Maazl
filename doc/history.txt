PM123's History
===============

    - Docking of windows became more accurate and powerful.
    - Addition of a bookmark is disabled if is not present a loaded file.
    - Added a new option to properties dialog allowing to choose a font used
      for display of playing titles. All skinned and non skinned fonts are
      scrolled smoothly, therefore the "smooth scroller" plug-in is removed
      from PM123 distribution and "-smooth" commandline switch is ignored.
      The skin now can define a color of the non skinned font. The SKINUTIL
      also define this color during the WinAmp skin conversion.
    - Integrated last source codes of the Generalised Bitmap Module.
    - Previous song in "random mode" does go to the previous song played,
      and next song does go back to the same song.
    - More there are no messages about missed files at loading the playlist.
      Missed files are marked with a special icon and skipped at use of the
      playlist.
    - The sources now can be compiled via Open Watcom 1.5.
    - Added support of cyrillic letters (russian cp866) to the first default 
      skin font. Thanks to ntim.
    - The default skin draws a bitrate digit by digit. Therefore all possible
      bitrates now are displayed correctly.

    MPG123:
    - Improved support of VBR mp3 files having a correct VBR header. Also
      improved support of VBR files without such header: timers and length of
      a song can be wrong, but there are no jerks of the seek slider.

    REALEQ:
    - The mute controls of the left and right channel are placed correctly.
    ! Thanks to Marcel Muller for all following:
    - Now used FFT convolution algorithm. The FFT convolution is about 10 times
      faster than MMX.
    - Significantly improved filter kernel design.
    - Thread-safe plansize & FIRorder changes.
    - More aggressive window function.
    - Larger FIR size, now up to 12288.

    CDDAPLAY:
    - Now shows correct bitrate at playing a track. Thanks to ntim.

    WAVPLAY:
    - Now shows correct bitrate at playing a file. Thanks to ntim.

PM123 1.2
---------
    - PM123 is now free software!  It is released under a BSD-style license.
      The OS/2 market is no longer viable, but thanks to all who paid to make
      PM123 what it is today, and now have fun playing with the code.
      If however you would like us to do work on PM123 under a contract,
      please do contact us.

    - Path with no trailing backslash would not work with wavout.dll
    - I hope I fixed all crash in os2audio.dll ...
    - Fixed a few minor bugs in playlist playback and reduced delays
    - Added "don't make PM123 wait on buffer" in os2audio settings.
      Makes for less delays between songs in playlist, but synchronization
      is all screwed up... use at your own risk.  Might be improved in the
      future if I come up with any magic ideas.
    - Timing problem with "*status" return values from \\PIPE\PM123 fixed!
    - "*status" would only work when a song is playing.
    - Fix crash and other problems when moving entries in playlist.
    - Added support for WM_CHANGEBR to update the bitrate display in real-time
      to reflect the current bitrate of VBR MP3s.
    - Manual updated thanks to Filip Molcan <molcanf@seznam.cz>
    - Filenames longer than 100 characters can now be loaded properly.
    - Fixed a bug in playlist recursive add where PM123 would not read
      some directories at all (giving errors like "can't read x:\dir1\dir1")

    - Fixed more floating point crashes (any left?) due to corrupted MP3.
    - Fixed a buffer overload crash that would sometimes happen.
    - Added support for WM_CHANGEBR
    - Enhanced MP3 detection mechanism.  Once more less non-MP3 are identified
      as MP3 files..

----------------
    - fixed unjustified "could not load some bitmap" errors from loading skins.
    - wavplay.dll would play part of the last buffer twice.
    - fixed another possible crash in os2audio.dll, should be crashless now. <g>
    - Everything now compiled with VAC++ 3.08 (instead of GCC/EMX)!!!
      Gone are the weird PMSHELL hanging stack overflow problems related to
      thread issues with EMX.
    - Skins now load their analyzer .dat file from their respective directory.
    - Equalized sound was not updated when loading .EQ file.
    - All INI files are now saved in pm123.exe directory, including analyzer.ini
      and scroller.ini.  **DELETE OLD ANALYZER.INI**
    - ID3 Tag Editor no longer crashes in PMCTLS.DLL, it updates the main
      window info display, and the year is now loaded properly.
    - Mutes and Preamp were not restored properly in the EQ.
    - RealEQ updated to 1.20 -> now you can save your settings in .REQ files.

      (analyzer.dll uses it)
    - Playlist Manager now indicates "no statistics" when there is none.
    - Playlist Manager now opens to the Playlist directory when adding playlists.
    - Filenames with a ';' can now be loaded in playlists.  An encoding scheme
      a la URL using % is now automatically so all filenames containing
      the wildest characters you can imagine coming from your server will load
      properly.

mpg123.dll 1.11 in pm123 1.1 beta 3:
    - HTTP content length was not always found from some HTTP servers. fixed in

      directly, making them easy to use.
    - Root directories can now be loaded from the file dialog kludge.
    - Loaded directories using the file dialog kludge are now saved.
    - Defaults and Undo do not double plug-ins entries anymore,
      although they still do not do anything useful for plug-ins.
    - Added "Save stream" in main menu to save data on disk before it is
      decoded.

      ***DELETE YOUR OLD INI FILE!!***
    - Last .EQ file loaded are now reloaded on startup.
    - Changed .EQ file format.  Now saves the gain in floating point value,
      instead of system dependent pixel slider values.
    - It is now possible to open more than one instance of the PM123
      process. Pipes created by the new processes will be \pipe\pm123_2
      and \pipe\pm123pl_2, and successive instances will increment that
      number in their pipe names.
    - Visual plug-ins with cx or cy smaller or equal to 0 will no longer
      be deinit and reinit when changing main window size (tiny, small, normal).
    - Load Track dialog now keeps in memory last drive used and automatically
      refreshes.
    - CD Tracks can now be loaded in the playlist.
    - analyzer.dll does not crash anymore if DIVE cannot be allocated.

    - Implemented title streaming code, and code for "Save stream".
    - SHOUTcast and icecast server information now passed on to pm123 with
      decoder_fileinfo().
    - Fixed problem with calculation of average bitrate, and of seeking, for
      VBR MP3s.
    - Increased first MPEG header from 10K to 128K.  I hope this is enough
      for all MP3s with bitmaps (yes images geez) before the MP3 itself.
    - Should not crash on corrupted Xing VBR headers anymore.
    - Read ahead buffer thread now runs at critical priority, so no more skip
      when read ahead buffer is activated.

PM123 1.1 beta 1
----------------
    - Fixed file with spaces in pipe commands.
    - execmode -sp executed on pm123.exe so it now runs in Warp Server 4 SMP
    - Patched notebook loading problem with Default display settings.
    - Adjusted equalizer dialog frequencies to correspond with new mpg123 values.
    - Fixed auto-play on load when another stream is playing.
    - Implemented new decoder, filter and output plugins.  For this beta,
      very little plug-ins are fully functional.
    - Playback of playlist does not close the output plug-in between playback
      of the entries anymore.
    - "Use this playlist" and next/previous now loads the ID3 Tag.
    - "Default display" now works everywhere.
    - Playlist now continues playing after selecting a song from the playlist.
    - Drag and drop from the playlist to main window now works properly.
    - Random button does random playback again, not sorting.  Random is
      also much faster than it was in beta 2. Use "Random" in the Sort submenu
      if you want to do playlist shuffling.
    - Repeat and Random playback state are now reloaded after launch.
    - Fixed random crash when adding with recurse, I hope...
    - Repeat now works in all conditions.
    - Adding to a playlist before the current loaded song now updates its index.
    - Deleting from a playlist before the current loaded song now also updates
      its index.
    - Directories can now be added from the "Add to list" file dialog.
      This is basically a hack in the file dialog. Unless you manually type
      the path, the directory will have to be selected in the directory listbox
      AND it must be the current directory listed in the file listbox AND
      the filename entry field must be empty, or "*" or the default "*.*".
    - HUGE playlist (~900 songs and more) are now able to load.
    - pm123 doesn't crash when loading playlist from the command line
      for an already opened instance.  This includes .m3u since they are
      now loaded as playlists.
    - Fixed problem when loading playlist and a song from the unloaded
      playlist was already playing.
    - Deleting entries from a playlist doesn't auto-use use it anymore.
    - Sorting by size and time is now much faster.
    - Loading entries from the playlist now actually loads the right entry,
      not just the one with the same exact filename.  but this basically
      makes it faster...
    - Added support for WinAmp style .pls playlist files including SHOUTcast.
      Titles for SHOUTcast servers are loaded from the .pls so you see all
      the neat stuff like the load of the servers when you load the playlist.
    - Fixed problem loading HTTP URLs with no path like on SHOUTcast.
    - Included procedure in netscape.html to properly configure pm123 as a
      Netscape Navigator helper application.
    - Fixed memory leak when removing entries from the playlist.
    - Streaming buffer now works properly and continues playing buffered
      stream even if read operations are stalled.
    - Broken HTTP connections are now properly canceled and closed on stop.
    - Added workaround for timing problem in DART for setting volume right
      after the device is opened.
    - HTTP URL with no filename like SHOUTcast now show the complete host
      instead of interpreting it as a filename. Title streaming is on its
      way...

mpg123.dll 1.09 in pm123 1.1 beta 1:
    - Fixed streaming audio by adding two in a row header checking.
    - Implements new pm123 decoder plug-in interface.

mpg123.dll 1.08:
    - Fixed floating point exception crashes.  Let me know if you can
      still reproduce any SYS3183.
    - Fixed problem with MP3 EQ range calculation with low frequency
      overflowing table and screwing up memory when MPEG 2.5 Layer III files
      were played.
    - Added support for virtual hostnames in HTTP123.DLL
    - In HTTP123.DLL, fixed seeking (and also loading) problems and glitches,
      especially with slow media (like CD-ROMs) and big read buffers.  But be
      wise, Read Ahead buffering produces an unnecessary overhead on fast
      media.
    - Added mp3->wav decoder.  Command line utility only for now.
    - For developers, added a play status semaphore.  It can be used to sleep
      instead of DosSleep() with the advantage of knowing exactly when the
      player stops.

mpg123.dll 1.07:
    - Fixed MMPM crash when DART underrun occurs.
    - Fixed Equalizer mute crash.
    - FileInfo (in playlist) was always reporting 0 length songs.

mpg123.dll 1.06:
    - Fixed possible infinite loop in read ahead header.
    - Added support for Xing Variable Bitrate MP3s.
    - Added auto-repause kludge so that when MMOS/2 gives access back to the
      sound device, the bug in MMOS/2 doesn't unpause mpg123.
    - Added new 10 bands ISO normal frequency equalizer for MP3s *only*.  The
      interface (which also needs to be fixed) will not be updated until
      Taneli has more time on his hands, but here are the bands.  Also note
      that the decibel calculation was wrong before (way too loud):

     31.5 Hz
     63.0 Hz
     125  Hz
     250  Hz
     500  Hz
     1.00 kHz
     2.00 kHz
     4.00 kHz
     8.00 kHz
     16.0 KHz

mpg123.dll 1.05:
    - 12kHz MPEG 2.5 Layer 3 files now play.
    - Added fix for new Xing encoded MP3s from mpg123 0.59q
    - Added read ahead header check.  This should make ALL valid MP3s even
      with borked headers work, and should not identify anything else than
      MPEG audio files as MPEG audio files such as bitmaps lying around in
      your MP3 directories.
    - Added fix for Aurora from dink.

mpg123.dll 1.04:
    - oops, broke some MP3s for nothing, it's back all right now
    - play 48 at 44 works right now

mpg123.dll 1.03:
    - found some Audio MPEG Header documentation.  Should now work with any
      MP3s other players or decoders play, if not, please contact me.  I've
      also fixed 8000Hz MP3 support, cool.
    - patched possible divide by zero when loading corrupted files.

mpg123.dll 1.02:
    - implemented workaround for bad GUS driver DART buffer timing (it jumps by
      250 ms step once in a while instead of incrementing for each buffer).
      Makes decoderPlayingSamples() work correctly on GUS.
    - finally found the proper buffers to flush.  no more first buffer trash
      kludge and now any snap crackle and pop are REALLY only coming from your
      sound card alone (check the visual plugins if you don't believe me)
    - faster seek by boosting priority (oops, forgot this initially :)
    - audio engine now fills empty buffers with 128 value instead of 0 for 8
      bit playback (removes the clicks, but it still sounds like shit :).

      which can be activated by starting PM123 with the "-smooth" switch
    - Improved 256-color support
    - Shift-click Play/Stop button while playing to fade out and stop playing

mpg123.dll in pm123 1.01:
    - fixed timing bug between MP123_PLAY and MP123_STOP
    - added buffer mode to HTTP123.DLL and in MPG123.DLL.  rewing and fast
      forward will give a quirk in buffer mode sometimes.

    Plus those regular bug fixes...

mpg123.dll in pm123 1.0:
    - decoderFileInfo can now be called more than once at the same time
    - kludged the jump to command to trash the first buffer (until I figure out
      more on the digital audio processing and where it keeps the buffer)
    - enlarged filename length from ~512 to ~1024, allows for bigger URL I
      guess.
    - now compiled with VAC++, works better with DLLs than EMX
    - RxDecoderError now works
    - decoderError now reports non-critical errors
    - decoderError now queues error messages, empty it, or you'll memory leak
    - added filter plugins
    - added possibility to change the decoder's band gain (there are only 32
      linear bands, at the moment, this means at a sample rate of 44100, ~689Hz
      per band = 44100/2/32) they suck BTW
    - added decoderPlayingSamples, to catch a few samples realtime from the
      OS/2 DART audio system to display real time stuff like an oscilloscope
      or a spectrum analyzer.  Note, it will get a buffer length in bytes, you
      have to calculate how many of them you need according to the
      bitspersample and channels.
    - decoderFileInfo now reports 0 on success and some error code otherwize.
    - decoderPlaying extention as decoderStatus
    - new kludge that plays 48kHz PCM at 44.1kHz.  This is really ugly, you
      don't hear a big difference, but you're better off converting it.  If you
      are wondering why I'm not converting it realtime 1. more CPU time needed
      *OR* 2. sounds real bad (aliasing and company)
    - HTTP module now in HTTP.DLL

PM123 pre 1.0 Beta 2
--------------------
    - Added keyboard shortcuts:
       * Left/Right = Rewind/Fast Forward
       * Enter = Play/Stop
       * 5 (on numeric keypad) = Pause
       * Up/Down = Next/Previous song
       * Alt F4 = Quit
       * +/- = Increase/Decrease volume

       (every option underlined in menu can be access directly by
        pressing Alt and the underlined key, even outside the menu)

    - Added skin support
    - Fixed shuffle
    - Fixed RIFF headered and/or broken MP3 support
    - Added seek slider (grab seek slider to move within MP3)
    - Fixed control button errors
    - Enhanced/fixed tag editor
    - WarpAMP playlist loading

    Plus various bug fixes...

MPG123.DLL in pm123 beta 2:
    - decoderTime(PLAYEDSECS) now shows the position being played, not decoded.
    - when buffers are trashed for rew and ffwd, the mpeg stream file position
      is brought to the file position that the decoder was at when it filled
      the currently playing audio buffer.
    - the decoderTime(TOTALSECS) now reports something until all audio buffers
      are played.
    - max buffers locked to 200 and min to 5. these are 16KB buffers, and they
      seem like absolute limits anyway.
    - fix crash when there was an MCI error when starting playing and pm123
      already played something before (trying to free memory it didn't
      allocate)
    - the first buffer is trashed to prevent the playing of the last buffer of
      the previous stream (I can't figure out what's going on, help me!!!)
      Whatever snaps, crackles and pops left are due to your MPEG streams
      or your sound card.
    - new decoderFileInfo().  allows program that need to check validity or
      specs of an mpeg stream with mpg123
    - stop now unpauses the stream before closing.
    - opening http streams should work better now.
    - much better rewind and fast forward (makes jumptosecs work a lot better
      too)
    - reporting errors should be more reliable
    - http routines now report usable error messages
    - http routines now check for "Content-Length" to determine total time
    - seeking and timer routines now use the file position instead of keeping
      track of the frame numbers.  makes the decoder faster and more consistent
      with the total time.
    - added REXX support ... hum

PM123 pre 1.0 Beta 1
--------------------
    - First public release

MPG123.DLL in pm123 beta 1:
    - initial release

realeq.dll
==========

1.0  - Initial release

1.01 - Some bug fixes (??)

1.1  - Implemented MMX !!! Wow, this really kicks arse...
     - Now using the Hamming window instead of von Hann.
     - Now using the ISO R10 standard serie.
     - Changed when calculations are made, snappier GUI, and doesn't make
       noise when adjusting the EQ anymore.

1.11 - MMX check box was not restored

1.20 - Equalizer Settings can now be saved in seperate .REQ files.
     - Removed unused variables from memory,
       might be faster on small L1 cache CPUs (ie.: not AMD CPUs)
     - Corrected imprecision reading slider values.
