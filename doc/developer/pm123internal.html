<h2>PM123's main internal structure</h2>
<p>PM123 consists of several logical <em>components</em> that <em>run asynchronously
    in seperate threads</em>. This keeps the user interface responsive even in case of a job with
  longer duration like a network timeout.</p>
<p>The components are:</p>
<ul>
  <li>the <a href="#play_controller">Play Controller</a>,</li>
  <li>the <a href="#decoder_engine">Decoder Engine</a>,</li>
  <li>the <a href="#user_interface">User Interface</a>,</li>
  <li>the <a href="#pipe_interface">Pipe Interface</a> and</li>
  <li>the <a href="#object_repository">Object Repository</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p>The Play Controller and the Object Repository are new with PM123 1.40.</p>

<h3><a name="play_controller"></a>The Play Controller</h3>
<p>The Play Controller starts at PM123 start-up and controls any play-back
  relevant activities. These are:</p>
<ul>
  <li><em>Play</em>, <em>Stop</em>, <em>Pause</em> commands.</li>
  <li><em>Load</em> new objects into the player.</li>
  <li><em>Navigation</em> (jump, fast forward, rewind).</li>
  <li>Saving of the input stream.</li>
  <li>Invokation of decoders, filters and output plug-ins.</li>
  <li>Advance to the next item in playlist mode.</li>
  <li>Prefech items in playlist mode.</li>
  <li>Keep the playing position.</li>
</ul>
<p>The Play Controller receives all instructions by a <em>command queue</em>.
  The queue is always processed in order. Multiple commands may be linked togehter.
  Linked commands are placed as unit in the queue and cannot be intercepted
  by commands from another source.</p>
<p>Changes in the play status are immediatle reflected to all observers by asynchronous
  notifications, except for the playing position, which obviously changes continously.
  The playing position has to be polled explicitely.</p>
<p>When an item completed to decode in playlist mode, the Play Controller imediately
  starts to decode the next playlist item even if the current item is not yet
  played completely. This results in a <em>pipeline of prefetched items</em> which may
  contain multiple items if they are short enough.</p>
<h3><a name="decoder_engine" id="decoder_engine"></a>The Decoder Engine</h3>
<p>Once a decoder plug-in begins to decode an item, it starts a <em>seperate
  thread</em>  that sends the decoded data through the data interface to the
  filter plug-ins and finally to the output plug-in. The plug-in chain is connected
  by the <a href="#play_controller">Play Controller</a> when the playback starts.
  It is not disconnected between playlist items to prevent gaps between songs.
  But different decoders may be attached to the chain when the input format changes.</p>
<p>The decoder engine alsways has exactly one active decoder. If playback is
  stopped, the decoder engine terminates.</p>
<p>PM123 allways works internally with 16 bits per sample raw PCM data, to keep
  the complexity of the filter plug-ins low. If an older decoder returns data
  in a different format it is converted on the fly.</p>
<h3><a name="user_interface"></a>The User Interface</h3>
<p>The User Interfaces controlls the <em>application windows</em> like <a href="mainwin.html">Main
  Window</a>, <a href="playlist.html">Playlist</a> and <a href="manager.html">Playlist
  Manager</a>, <a href="bookmark.html">Bookmarks</a> and <a href="infodialog.html#metainfo">Tag
  Editor</a>. Almost any
  actions are executed in the asyncronously <a href="#play_controller">Play Controller</a> or
  the <a href="#object_repository">Object Repository</a>.
  Only actions, that only affect the User Interface itself or that are edit operations
  like modification of playlists or song tags, are performed directly.</p>
<p>The User interface windows are synchronized by the <a href="#object_repository">Object
    Repository</a>. Any changes to
  the Object Repository are immediately reflected to the User Interface by notifications
  (also called events). It makes no difference whether the change is a result
    of user action, a pipe command or any other asynchronous update like a changing
    stream title from an internet stream or a file system notification.</p>
<h3><a name="pipe_interface"></a>The Pipe Interface</h3>
<p>The Pipe interface provides similar functionality than the User Interface
  to remote applications. It can handle a set of <a href="remoteref.html">pipe
  commands</a> to <em>control PM123
  remotely</em>. The pipe listener is started at PM123 start-up. It can handle only
  one remote connection at the same time, since it makes little sense to control
  PM123 from different applications simultaneously.</p>
<h3><a name="object_repository"></a>The Object Repository</h3>
<p>The Object Repository keeps track of the <em>physical information</em>, <em>technical
  information</em> (including <em>playlist content</em>) and <em>meta information</em> of
  all playable objects in PM123. The <em>primary key</em> of all repository objects
  is their
  <em>URL</em>. None of the above information on playable objects may exists
  outside the Object Repository.</p>
<p>The information in the Object Repository is usually updated by a couple of
  <em>worker threads</em> which receive their commands by a <em>Request Queue</em>.
  The Request Queue handles information requests on playable objects at <em>two
  priorities</em>. High priority requests are used if the <a href="#play_controller">Play
  Controller</a> or
  a user action or a pipe command requires the desired information. Low priority
  requests are used for prefetching information on items that are likely to be
  used soon or if some information change requires dependent information in other
  playable objects to be updated, e.g. when the total playing time of a playlist
  changes if one of the nested playlists is modified. The number of worker threads
  controls the throughput of the Request Queue, but it also can end up with
  heavy I/O load on the system if too many workers are on the way.</p>
<p>The Object Repository provides notifications to observers like the <a href="#user_interface">User
    Interface</a>  when information in the repository is refreshed. <em>Edit
    operations</em> are applied
  directly
  to the
  items in the Object Repository and then the resulting change is again signalled
  to the User Interface
  by the notification mechanism.</p>
<p>The <em>object lifetime</em> of repository objects is managed automatically.
  If no other component (including other playable objects) holds a strong reference
  to a repository object, the object is removed from memory after a while. The
  latency effectively forms a <em>cache</em> of repository objects. PM123 uses
  reference counting to keep track of the needed objects. In case of cyclic references
  (recursive
playlists) the objects are never removed from memory until PM123 terminates.</p>
