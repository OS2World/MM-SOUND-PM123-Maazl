<h2>PM123 Drag and drop format
</h2>
PM123 supports the following drag and drop formats:<br>
<ul>
  <li><b>DRM_DISCARD</b> (source only)</li>
  <li><b>DRM_OS2FILE</b> (target only)</li>
  <li><b>DRM_123PI</b> - PlayableInstance of PM123<b> </b></li>
</ul>
<h3><tt>DRM_DISCARD</tt> (playlist, target)
</h3>
<p><tt>DRM_DISCARD</tt> is supported by <a
 href="../manual/playlist.html">playlist</a>
and <a href="../manual/manager.html">playlist manager</a> windows to
remove items from the playlist.</p>
<h3><tt>DRM_123LST</tt> (playlist, source)</h3>
<p>The render method <tt>DRM_123LST</tt> passes the URL of the
enclosing
playlist in <tt>hstrContainerName</tt>. Everything else is up to the <tt>DM_RENDER</tt>
message. <tt>DRM_123LST</tt> always only reports only one item to <tt>DrgDrag</tt>,
regardless how many items are dragged. When this item is rendered, it
receives a list of items in a temporary playlist file. The file name is
chosen by the target in <tt>hstrRenderToName</tt>.</p>
<p>Normally, the source is responsible for the source related stuff and
the target is responsible for the target related stuff. So a <tt>DO_MOVE</tt>
operation causes<br>
&nbsp;- an insert at the target and<br>
&nbsp;- a delete operation at the source.<br>
The latter is performed at <tt>DM_ENDCONVERSATION</tt>.</p>
<p>There is one exception. If<br>
&nbsp;- source and target refer to the same playlist container and<br>
&nbsp;- source and target refer to a window within the same PM123
instance<br>
then the target performs the move operation directly in place. In this
case it reports <tt>DMFL_TARGETFAIL</tt> although the drag and drop
succeeded to prevent the source from deleting the records.
</p>
<h3><tt>DRM_123LST</tt> (playlist, target)</h3>
<p>When a source with <tt>DRM_123LST</tt> is dropped on a playlist,
PM123 tells the source to render the temporary playlist with the
dropped items.</p>
<p>PM123 supports the actions <tt>DO_COPY</tt> and <tt>DO_MOVE</tt>.
In case of <tt>DO_MOVE</tt> the deletion in the source is performed by
the source unless source and target refer to the same playlist
container within the same PM123 instance, where the move operation is
performed by the target directly.</p>
<h3><tt>DRM_123LST</tt> (main window target)</h3>
<p>When dropping a playlist item on the player's main window, the
function 'load' is performed. The action <tt>DO_COPY</tt> indicates
that the item is immediately loaded into the player. The action <tt>DO_LINK</tt>
appends the items to the default playlist.
It depends on the player settings which one is the default. Multiple
items are always placed in the default playlist.</p>
<h3><tt>DRM_OS2FILE</tt> (playlist, target)</h3>
Dropping files on a playlist inserts links to the files immediately at
the location of the drop. Except for the file type <tt>UniformResourceLocator</tt>,
in which case the contained URL is inserted instead of the file itself.
The only supported operation is <tt>DO_LINK</tt>.<br>
<h3><tt>DRM_OS2FILE</tt> (main window, target)</h3>
<p>Dropping a file or folder on the player causes the object either to
be played immediately (<tt>DO_COPY</tt>) or to be appended to the
default playlist (<tt>DO_LINK</tt>). It depends on the player settings
which one is the default.</p>
