<h2>PM123 Playable object handling - Object properties</h2>
<h3>Information categories</h3>
<p>The
properties of a playable object are grouped into different <a
 href="../pdk/datatype.html#INFOTYPE">information
types</a>. Each group of information can be requested and
observed
individually. The groups fit into the following categories:</p>
<ol>
  <li>
    <p><b>Object information<br>
    </b>The object information lies on the
entity <a href="playableclasses.html#Playable">URL</a>. It
consists of<br>
- <a href="../pdk/datatype.html#PHYS_INFO">Physical
information</a>,<br>
- <a href="../pdk/datatype.html#TECH_INFO">Technical
information</a> and<br>
- <a href="../pdk/datatype.html#OBJ_INFO">Detailed object
information</a>.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><b>Logical object information</b><br>
The logical object information also lies on the entity <a
 href="playableclasses.html#Playable">URL</a> but it
may be overridden by <tt><a href="playableclasses.html#PlayableRef">PlayableRef</a></tt>.
It consists of<br>
- <a href="../pdk/datatype.html#META_INFO">Meta
information</a>
and<br>
- <a href="../pdk/datatype.html#ATTR_INFO">Object
attributes</a>.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><b>Aggregate information</b><br>
The aggregate information lies on the entity <em><a
 href="playableclasses.html#Playable">URL</a> with all
parent URLs in the call stack</em>. This is because all items in
the call stack are excluded from enumeration to avoid recursions. It
makes the aggregate information dependent on the point of view.<br>
It consists of<br>
- <a href="../pdk/datatype.html#RPL_INFO">Recursive
playlist information</a> and<br>
- <a href="../pdk/datatype.html#DRPL_INFO">Detailed
recursive
playlist information</a>.<br>
The aggregate information also applies to song items that cannot
contain sub items in the way that it takes care of <em>slices</em>
- unlike the detailed object information. </p>
    <p>Unlike all other kind of information the aggregate
information should be requested by <em><tt>RequestAggregateInfo</tt></em>.<br>
Furthermore it does not have its own events for each call stack. The
event fires if <i>any</i>
of the aggregate informations change. So if you want to track changes
of individual entries you have to compare the revision number of the
returned information. It is incremented on each update.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><b>Object reference information</b><br>
This kind of info lies on the entity <tt><a
 href="playableclasses.html#PlayableRef">PlayableRef</a></tt>.
Native objects do not have this properties. Currently this is only<br>
-&nbsp;<a href="../pdk/datatype.html#ITEM_INFO">Playlist
item information</a>.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><b>Runtime information</b><br>
This kind of information is not an object property. It is calculated at
runtime from one or more of the other informations above.</p>
  </li>
</ol>
<h3>Information state</h3>
<p>Each group of <em>information</em> has
the following <em>states</em>:</p>
<ul>
  <li><tt><b>REL_Virgin</b></tt> - not
yet available,</li>
  <li><tt><b>REL_Invalid</b></tt> -
information was available but has been invalidated,</li>
  <li><tt><b>REL_Cached</b></tt> - maybe
from a previous run of the application and</li>
  <li><tt><b>REL_Confirmed</b></tt> -
information is verified by the current application instance.</li>
</ul>
<p>Once a type of information is provided it will never return to
the state virgin. In doubt outdated information is returned.</p>
<p>When you request some kind of information you have the choice
to do this with different <em>reliability requirements</em>:</p>
<ul>
  <li><b><tt>REL_Cached</tt></b> - a
cached information is sufficient but load the information if it is not
yet available.</li>
  <li><b><tt>REL_Confirmed</tt></b> -
reload the information if it is only cached.</li>
  <li><b><tt>REL_Reload</tt></b> - reload
the information unconditional (user request).</li>
</ul>
<p>Furthermore you may chose a <em>priority level</em>:</p>
<ul>
  <li><b><tt>PRI_None</tt></b> - do not
request anything. This pseudo priority is used to obtain the current
state of information only.</li>
  <li><b><tt>PRI_Low</tt></b> - the
request is scheduled at low priority, used for prefetching.</li>
  <li><b><tt>PRI_Normal</tt></b> - the
request is scheduled at normal priority.</li>
  <li><b><tt>PRI_Sync</tt></b>
- the request is executed synchronously. In this case the current
thread temporarily joins the pool of worker threads and executes the
given request exclusively. If this is not possible because another
(temporary) worker already retrieves some of the requested information,
the current thread will wait for that.</li>
</ul>
<h4>State graph</h4>
<p>The following graph illustrates all valid state transitions. All
changes are transactional.
</p>
<blockquote><img alt="Information state graph"
 src="images/stategraph.png" height="499" width="583">
</blockquote>
<p>The <em>flash symbols</em> indicate that a state <em>change
event</em> informs the observers.<br>
The <em>clock symbols</em> indicate that the state
transition occurs in <em>synchronized</em> context. Any
other transitions are <em>lock-free</em>. Note that the state
transitions are
synchronized, not the retrieval of the information. This is done while
in service. And the synchronized part is like a commit work.
</p>
<h4>Processes</h4>
<p>The processes that cause state transitions are:</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p><font color="#6000c0"><b>Info request</b></font>
- An Information might be requested either at low or at high priority.
The information is then obtained asynchronously by a worker thread. Use
the <tt>InfoChange</tt> event to wait for the desired
information to become available.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><font color="#ff6000"><b>Begin update</b></font>
- Once a worker thread picks up a request it marks the information as <i>in
service</i>. Only one thread can mark an information as in
service at a time. The begin update process is seperately synchronized
for each
playable
object but <em>the object must not be locked while the
information is retrieved</em>.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><font color="green"><b>End update</b></font>
- When the information has been retrieved it is applied <em>synchronized</em>
and it's state is set to <i>confirmed</i>.
Exception: if the information has been invalidated while it was in
service PM123 assumes that too old infos might have been used and the
state
remains invalid.<br>
End update <em>raises the <tt>InfoChanged</tt>
event with <tt>Loaded</tt> and maybe&nbsp;<tt>Changed</tt></em>.
Note that the information might have been invalidated meanwhile and
therefore may not have the desired reliability at the point of this
event. You need to reschedule the requst if this is not suitable. But
beware of infinite loops. </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><font color="red"><b>Invalidate</b></font>
- Sometimes an information is invalidated. If the information was at
least in cached state before <em>the <tt>InfoChage</tt>
event is raised with <tt>Invalidated</tt></em>
immediately. Invalidation also changes the state from virgin to invalid
to avoid that (invalid) cached information is applied later.<br>
Invalidation
happens for instance when an item is added to a playlist. In this case
the total playing time of this playlist and all lists that refer to it
is invalidated.<br>
Invalidating
an information does not automatically
cause the information to be reloaded unless the invalidation occurs
while the information is in service. In this case the previous request
state is restored. Otherwise it has to be requested again. If you need
to be always up
to date place a request in the <tt>InfoChange</tt> event
handler if an <tt>Invalidated</tt> event arrives.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><font color="#606060"><b>Cache available</b></font>
- When PM123 loads a playlist the playlist may contain cached
information about its content. This will speed up PM123 because not all
objects have to be requested for information. On the other hand
outdated information may show up. Cached information is applied <em>synchronized</em>
and only if this kind of information is not yet available or
invalidated (virgin). In
case the information changes <em><tt>InfoChange</tt>
with <tt>Change</tt> is raised</em>. Note that the <span
 style="font-family: monospace;">Loaded</span> flag is <i>not</i>
included in
this case since nothing has been recently loaded. </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><font color="#006060"><b>Outdate</b></font>
- PM123 may mark an information that has been retrieved a long time ago
as outdated. The state is set to cached. This does not raise any event.</p>
  </li>
</ul>
