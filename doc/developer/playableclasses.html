<h2>PM123 Playable object handling - Classes</h2>
<h3>Class Tree</h3>
<p><img alt="class tree" src="images/playableclasses.png"
 usemap="#playableclasses" height="672" width="768">&nbsp;<map
 name="playableclasses">
</map>
</p>
<h3><tt><b><b><a name="APlayable"></a>class APlayable</b></b></tt></h3>
<p>This abstract base class is used as least common denominator
of all objects that can be played with PM123 in any way.</p>
<p>The <em>concept</em> behind all of these objects is
that they provide different kinds of information (see <tt>InfoFlags</tt>)
and all of these <em>information is to be <a href="playableasync.html">requested</a>
before it is
used</em>.
Failing to do so will cause undefined results like initial structures
or outdated content, but it will <i>not</i> cause
undefined behavior like an
application crash.</p>
<h4>Services</h4>
<ul>
  <li>The only service that is directly provided by this class is
the <a href="playableasync.html"><em>asynchronous request service</em></a>.</li>
  <li>For efficiency reasons the <tt>InfoChange</tt>
event is included as class member. It is required by any deriving class
anyway.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Properties</h4>
<ul>
  <li>The objects are <em>reference countable</em>,
i.e. they implement <tt>Iref_count</tt>. This belongs to
all derived classes. You must not use any of this classes without
holding a strong reference to it with an <tt>int_ptr&lt;&gt;</tt>
instance. However, this does not imply that all access have been done
through <tt>int_ptr&lt;&gt;</tt>.
E.g. in case of a function argument it is guaranteed that the callee
has a strong reference too, as long as you do not keep the reference
after the function returns.</li>
  <li>The objects are <em>non-copyable</em>. This
may be overridden in derived classes by taking the appropriate actions.</li>
</ul>
<h3><tt><b><b><tt><b><b><a name="Playable"></a>class
</b></b></tt></b></b>Playable</tt></h3>
<p>A <tt>Playable</tt> object is the <em>1:1 representation of a URL</em>
in PM123. At most one <tt>Playable</tt> instance may exist for each
URL. This is
ensured by a private constructor and an instance repository. Use
<tt>GetByUrl</tt> to access or create instances of <tt>Playable</tt>.<br>
</p>
<p>If a playable object is enumerable (e.g. a playlist) it has an
additional extension object called <tt>PlaylistData</tt>. You cannot
access this data directly. It is only used internally to keep the
memory footprint of non-playlist objects small.<br>
</p>
<h4>Services</h4>
<ul>
  <li>The <a href="internal.html#object_repository"><em>object
repository</em></a>,</li>
  <li>the <em>interface to the plug-ins</em>,</li>
  <li>the <em>object state</em> and</li>
  <li>the <em>tracking of</em> property <em>changes</em>.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Properties</h4>
<ul>
  <li><tt>Playable</tt> objects are <em>unique</em>
in the way that for each (equivalent) URL only one object exists. This
causes all related information to be consistent in the whole
application.</li>
</ul>
<h3><tt><b><b><tt><b><b><a name="PlayableSlice"></a>class
</b></b></tt></b></b>PlayableSlice</tt></h3>
<p>A <tt>PlayableSlice</tt> is a <em>reference
to an <a href="#APlayable"><tt>APlayable</tt></a></em> object which
only addresses a slice of the referenced object. It overrides the <a
 href="../pdk/datatype.html#ITEM_INFO">ITEM_INFO</a> containing an
optional alias name optional <em>start and a stop locations</em> and
the
aggregate properties that depend on this values.</p>
<p>The locations are originally stored as <a
 href="../manual/location.html">PM123 location strings</a>.
This causes a delayed verification of their values and allows to set
them while the referenced content is not yet available.</p>
<p><tt>PlayableSlice</tt> objects may be <em>nested</em>.
In this case the outer <tt>PlayableSlice</tt> represents
the intersection of the two slices. </p>
<h4>Services</h4>
<ul>
  <li>Methods to <em>read the start and stop
location</em>.</li>
  <li><em>Validation</em> of the start and stop
position and</li>
  <li>calculation of the recursive playlist information based on
the slice.</li>
  <li>The <tt>PlayableSlice</tt> has an <em>in-use
flag</em> that implies that the underlying playable is in use but
not the other way around.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Properties</h4>
<ul>
  <li>In contrast to <tt>Playable</tt> a <tt>PlayableSlice</tt>
is <em>non-unique</em> and</li>
  <li>it is <em>copyable</em>. But note that
copying does not affect the <tt>InfoChange</tt> event
consumers.</li>
</ul>
<h3><tt><b><b><tt><b><b><a name="PlayableRef"></a>class
</b></b></tt></b></b>PlayableRef</tt></h3>
<p>This is a refinement of <a href="#PlayableSlice"><tt>PlayableSlice</tt></a>
that allows to <em>override attribute and meta information</em> too.<br>
</p>
<h4>Services</h4>
<ul>
  <li>Methods to override properties.</li>
  <li>Notification logic that takes care of the overridden
information.</li>
</ul>
<h3><tt><b><b><tt><b><b><a name="PlayableInstance"></a>class
</b></b></tt></b></b>PlayableInstance</tt></h3>
<p>A <tt>PlayableInstance</tt> is playlist item, no
more, no less. It is mainly the same than <a href="#PlayableRef"><tt>PlayableRef</tt></a>,
but it keep track of the location in the playlist. A <tt>PlayableInstance</tt>
belongs to exactly one <tt>Playable</tt> of playlist type or it is
orphaned, i.e. removed from the playlist but still alive because of
strong references. This causes defined behavior when
removing a currently playing object from a playlist. Orphaned items
never can be reattached to a playlist.<br>
</p>
<h4>Services</h4>
<ul>
  <li>Keep track of the <em>index</em> within the
surrounding collection.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Properties</h4>
<ul>
  <li>It is <em>non-copyable</em>.</li>
  <li>It weakly <em>depends on a <tt>Playable</tt></em>
(playlist). You cannot get a strong reference to the enclosing
collection from that.</li>
  <li>A <tt>PlayableInstance</tt> may only be
created by a <tt>Playable</tt>,
but it may be removed from the collection and stay alive as long as
there are active referenced to it.</li>
</ul>
<h3><tt><a name="Location"></a>class Location</tt></h3>
<p>A <tt>Location</tt> is a <em>pointer to a particular position
within any playable</em> object. It may point to a time offset within a
song as well as to a deep location inside a nested playlist structure
and keep track of the navigation path.</p>
<h4>Services</h4>
<ul>
  <li>A <tt>Location</tt> provides methods to <em>navigate</em> in
various ways.</li>
  <li>A <tt>Location</tt> can be (de)<em>serialized from/to a </em><em>string</em>.</li>
  <li>It provides methods to calculate <em>partial aggregate
information</em> of its root that covers either the part before the
location or the part after the location.<br>
  </li>
</ul>
<h4>Properties</h4>
<ul>
  <li>A <tt>Location</tt> always belongs to some <em>Playable as root
object</em>.</li>
  <li>It keeps only a <em>weak reference to its root</em>. This
reference is unchecked, so a location<em> must not exceed the lifetime
of its root</em>.</li>
  <li>Locations that belong to the same root are <em>comparable</em>.<br>
  </li>
</ul>
<h3><tt><a name="SongIterator"></a>class SongIterator</tt></h3>
<p>A <tt>SongIterator</tt> is a refinement of a <a href="#Location"><tt>Location</tt></a>
that provides additional Methods to keep track of the flattened
playlist offsets.</p>
<h4>Services</h4>
<ul>
  <li>Calculate the offsets (songs and time) within the current root.<br>
  </li>
</ul>
<h3><tt>class CallstackEntry</tt></h3>
<p>This is only used by <a href="songiterator.html"><tt>SongIterator</tt></a>
instances to keep track of the current call stack.</p>
<h4>Services</h4>
<ul>
  <li>Provide <em>offset information</em> within the
current item.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Properties</h4>
<ul>
  <li>It is <em>non-copyable</em>.</li>
</ul>
