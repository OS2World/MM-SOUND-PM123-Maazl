    <h2>PM123 Filter Plugins</h2>
    <p>
      Filter plugins must implement and export the functions defined in
      filter_plug.h. The interface has changed with plugin level 2.
      Although they look very similar they are completely different.</p>
    <h3>Interface level 3 (current)</h3>
    <pre>     ULONG DLLENTRY <b>filter_init</b>(void** <var>f</var>, FILTER_PARAMS2* <var>params</var>)</pre>
    <ul>
      <li><var><tt>f</tt></var> - Allocate any chunk of memory necessary
        for the filter's
        function.
        This pointer will be passed to the any other function call into the
        filter plugin.</li>
      <li>Make a copy of all fields in the <code>FILTER_PARAMS2</code>
        structure that you need later or copy the entire structure.</li>
      <li>Replace the entry points in the <code>FILTER_PARAMS2</code>
        structure that you want to virtualize. Keep in mind that implementing a
        no-op will at least require to replace the first parameter <code>a</code>
        to each function by <code>params-&gt;f</code>. If yo do not change a
        individual function pointer the plugin manager will do this job for
        you.</li>
      <li><i>return value</i> - <tt>0</tt> means the filter was
        initialized successfully.
        Any other value indicates an error and <tt>filter_uninit</tt> will not
        be called
        in this case.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>A level 3 filter plugin may completely virtualize the output of
      data. It may change the sampling rate, it may change the number of
      bytes per samples or even the time axis. See the <a href="output_plug.html">output
        plugin interface description</a> for
      detailed information on the different functions.</p>
    <pre>     void DLLENTRY <b>filter_update</b>(void* <var>f</var>, const FILTER_PARAMS2* <var>params</var>)</pre>
    <p>This function is called to update the procedure entry points and the
      callback pointers that you received at the <code>filter_init</code>
      call. This will be used to load and/or unload filters at runtime by
      future versions of PM123. Be sure that the replacement of the entry
      points
      is an <em>atomic</em> operation. </p>
    <pre>     BOOL DLLENTRY <b>filter_uninit</b>(void* <var>f</var>)</pre>
    <p>Uninitialize the plugin, free any storage related to <var>f</var>
      and return TRUE unless you are in real big trouble. </p>
    <h3>Interface level 1 (supported by proxy)</h3>
    <pre>     ULONG DLLENTRY <b>filter_init  </b>(void** <var>f</var>, FILTER_PARAMS* <var>params</var>)<br>     BOOL  DLLENTRY <b>filter_uninit</b>(void*  <var>f</var>)</pre>
    <ul>
      <li><var><tt>f</tt></var> - Allocate any chunk of memory necessary
        for the filter's
        function. This pointer will be passed to the other filter_play_samples.
        At the very least, you need to allocate memory to keep the in memory
        the location of <tt>output_play_samples</tt> and it's parameter <var><tt>f</tt></var>.
      </li>
      <li><i>return value</i> - 0 means the filter was initialized
        successfully. </li>
    </ul>
    <p>The <tt>filter_init</tt> function is called when filter plugin is
      about to be used.
      Multiple filter plugins are chained, so the pointers to
      <tt>output_play_samples</tt> and it's parameter <var><tt>f</tt></var>,
      might belong to another
      filter plugin and not necessarily to the active output plugin.
    </p>
    <pre>     int DLLENTRY <b>filter_play_samples</b>(void* <var>f</var>, FORMAT_INFO* <var>format</var>, char* <var>buf</var>,<br>                                      int <var>len</var>, int <var>posmarker</var>)</pre>
    <ul>
      <li><var><tt>format</tt></var> - format of <var><tt>buf</tt></var>. </li>
      <li><var><tt>buf</tt></var> - data to play. </li>
      <li><var><tt>len</tt></var> - length of <var><tt>buf</tt></var> in
        bytes. </li>
      <li><var><tt>posmarker</tt></var> - position marker to return with <tt>output_playing_pos</tt>.
      </li>
      <li><i>return value</i> - the number of bytes from <var><tt>len</tt></var>
        processed. ie.: <tt>0</tt> <tt>==</tt>
        error. </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      This function is called by the decoder or a previous in chain filter
      plugin
      to filter samples. Note that this function's prototype is identical to
      <tt>output_play_samples</tt>. This makes it possible to chain filter
      plugins.
    </p>
    <p>Once you have modified the data in satisfactory way, call the
      <tt>output_play_samples</tt> function with it's parameter <var><tt>f</tt></var>
      received from
      the
      init function, and use it with the modified samples of your filter
      plugin.</p>
