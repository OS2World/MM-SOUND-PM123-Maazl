<h2>PM123 Filter Plug-ins</h2>
<p>
Filter plug-ins must implement and export the functions defined in
filter_plug.h. The interface has changed with plug-in level 2.
Although they look very similar they are completely different.</p>
<h3>Interface level 3 (current)</h3>
<pre>     ULONG DLLENTRY <b>filter_init</b>(void** <var>f</var>, FILTER_PARAMS2* <var>params</var>)</pre>
<ul>
  <li><var><tt>f</tt></var> - Allocate any chunk of memory necessary
for the filter's
function.
This pointer will be passed to the any other function call into the
filter plug-in.</li>
  <li>Make a copy of all fields in the <code>FILTER_PARAMS2</code>
structure that you need later or copy the entire structure.</li>
  <li>Replace the entry points in the <code>FILTER_PARAMS2</code>
structure that you want to virtualize. Keep in mind that implementing a
no-op will at least require to replace the first parameter <code>a</code>
to each function by <code>params-&gt;f</code>. If yo do not change a
individual function pointer the plug-in manager will do this job for
you.</li>
  <li><i>return value</i> - <tt>0</tt> means the filter was
initialized successfully.
Any other value indicates an error and <tt>filter_uninit</tt> will not
be called
in this case.</li>
</ul>
<p>A level 3 filter plug-in may completely virtualize the output of
data. It may change the sampling rate, it may change the number of
bytes per samples or even the time axis. See the <a
 href="output_plug.html">output plug-in interface description</a> for
detailed information on the different functions.</p>
<pre>     void DLLENTRY <b>filter_update</b>(void* <var>f</var>, const FILTER_PARAMS2* <var>params</var>)</pre>
<p>This function is called to update the procedure entry points and the
callback pointers that you received at the <code>filter_init</code>
call. This will be used to load and/or unload filters at runtime by
future versions of PM123. Be sure that the replacement of the entry
points
is an <em>atomic</em> operation. </p>
<pre>     BOOL DLLENTRY <b>filter_uninit</b>(void* <var>f</var>)</pre>
<p>Uninitialize the plug-in, free any storage related to <var>f</var>
and return TRUE unless you are in real big trouble. </p>
<h3>Interface level 1 (supported by proxy)</h3>
<pre>     ULONG DLLENTRY <b>filter_init  </b>(void** <var>f</var>, FILTER_PARAMS* <var>params</var>)<br>     BOOL  DLLENTRY <b>filter_uninit</b>(void*  <var>f</var>)</pre>
<ul>
  <li><var><tt>f</tt></var> - Allocate any chunk of memory necessary
for the filter's
function. This pointer will be passed to the other filter_play_samples.
At the very least, you need to allocate memory to keep the in memory
the location of <tt>output_play_samples</tt> and it's parameter <var><tt>f</tt></var>.
  </li>
  <li><i>return value</i> - 0 means the filter was initialized
successfully. </li>
</ul>
<p>The <tt>filter_init</tt> function is called when filter plug-in is
about to be used.
Multiple filter plug-ins are chained, so the pointers to
<tt>output_play_samples</tt> and it's parameter <var><tt>f</tt></var>,
might belong to another
filter plug-in and not necessarily to the active output plug-in.
</p>
<pre>     int DLLENTRY <b>filter_play_samples</b>(void* <var>f</var>, FORMAT_INFO* <var>format</var>, char* <var>buf</var>,<br>                                      int <var>len</var>, int <var>posmarker</var>)</pre>
<ul>
  <li><var><tt>format</tt></var> - format of <var><tt>buf</tt></var>. </li>
  <li><var><tt>buf</tt></var> - data to play. </li>
  <li><var><tt>len</tt></var> - length of <var><tt>buf</tt></var> in
bytes. </li>
  <li><var><tt>posmarker</tt></var> - position marker to return with <tt>output_playing_pos</tt>.
  </li>
  <li><i>return value</i> - the number of bytes from <var><tt>len</tt></var>
processed. ie.: <tt>0</tt> <tt>==</tt>
error. </li>
</ul>
<p>
This function is called by the decoder or a previous in chain filter
plug-in
to filter samples. Note that this function's prototype is identical to
<tt>output_play_samples</tt>. This makes it possible to chain filter
plug-ins.
</p>
<p>Once you have modified the data in satisfactory way, call the
<tt>output_play_samples</tt> function with it's parameter <var><tt>f</tt></var>
received from
the
init function, and use it with the modified samples of your filter
plug-in.</p>
