    <h2>PM123 Output Plugins</h2>
    <p>Output plugins must implement and export the functions defined in <tt>output_plug.h</tt>.
      There are different interface versions. It is recommended to use level 3.</p>
    <h3><a name="level_2"></a>Interface revision level 3 (recommended)</h3>
    <h4><a name="initialization_interface"></a>Initialization interface</h4>
    <p>The initialization interface does not need to be thread safe.</p>
    <blockquote>
      <pre><a name="output_init"></a>ULONG DLLENTRY <b>output_init</b>  (struct OUTPUT_STRUCT**<var> a</var>)<br><a

      <li><var><tt>a</tt></var> - Allocate any chunk of memory necessary for the
        output's function. This pointer will be passed to the other functions. </li>
      <li><var>return value</var> - <tt>PLUGIN_OK</tt> (<tt>0</tt>) means the
        output was initialized successfully. </li>
    </ul>
    <p>The <tt>output_init</tt> function is called when the user requests the
      use of your output plugin. So only one output plugin is active at any
      given time. It should initialize the control variables for an eventual
      call to <tt>output_command</tt> with <tt>OUTPUT_OPEN</tt>.<br>
      <tt>output_uninit</tt> is called when another output plugin is request by
      the user and should free the allocated memory for <tt><i>a</i></tt>.</p>
    <h4><a name="control_interface"></a>Control interface</h4>
    <p>The control interface does not need to be thread safe itself, but it is
      called from a different thread than the <a href="#data_interface">data
        interface</a>.</p>
    <blockquote>
      <pre><a name="output_command"></a>ULONG DLLENTRY <b>output_command</b>(struct OUTPUT_STRUCT* <var>a</var>, ULONG <var>msg</var>, OUTPUT_PARAMS2* <var>info</var>)</pre>
    </blockquote>
    <ul>
      <li><tt><var>msg</var></tt> - command to execute, see below </li>
      <li><tt><var>info</var></tt> - structure that contains the parameters
        needed by the preceding commands </li>
      <li><i>return value - </i><br>
        <tt>PLUGIN_OK</tt> (<tt>0</tt>) -&gt; O.K.<br>
        others -&gt; MMOS/2 errors or anything else. </li>
    </ul>
    The status graph is as follows:
    <ol>
      <li><code>OUTPUT_SETUP</code></li>
      <li><code>OUTPUT_OPEN</code> - now we are <em>active</em>. The <a href="#data_interface">data
          interface</a> may be used.<br>
        Optionally repeat this step if another song is to be played.</li>
      <li><code>OUTPUT_CLOSE</code> - now we are no longer active.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>The other function codes (<code>OUTPUT_VOLUME</code>, <code>OUTPUT_PAUSE</code>
      and <code>OUTPUT_TRASH_BUFFERS</code>) are allowed only in active mode.</p>
    <h5><tt>OUTPUT_SETUP</tt> - setup the event callback</h5>
    <p>Only the fields <tt>OutEvent</tt> and <tt>W</tt> should be read during
      this call.</p>
    <h5><tt>OUTPUT_OPEN</tt> - opens the device or file needed for output</h5>
    <p>This call tells the device about the object that is about to be played
      (fields <tt>URL</tt> and <tt>Info</tt>). The Output could use this
      information to get the format (sampling rate and channels) that is likely
      to come. The field <tt>PlayingPos</tt> contains the time index of the
      first sample of the decoded object. </p>
    <p>The <tt>URL</tt> parameter at the <code>OUTPUT_OPEN</code> call uses
      the following syntax:<br>
      <samp>file:///D:/Music/my favorite song.mp3</samp><br>
      <samp>file://server/share/favorite song.mp3</samp> (UNC path)<br>
      <samp>http://</samp>... (as you would expect)<br>
      <samp>cdda:///H:/track02</samp></p>
    <p>The URI may change during playback, if the playback moves to the next
      file in playlist mode. This is signaled with a new <code>OUTPUT_OPEN</code>
      call while the device is already open. The call is always before the first
      decoded samples of the mentioned object arrive. The new object's data
      start with the time index <tt>PlayingPos</tt>. Note that multiple short
      items might be in the processing queue before their samples arrive. But
      usually only one song is decoded in advance.<br>
      As long as you do not care about the new object you could ignore this
      message. But note that the format might change with a new item.</p>
    <h5><tt>OUTPUT_TRASH_BUFFERS</tt> - trash any buffers currently awaiting to
      be played</h5>
    <p>This command tells the output to discard any buffers not yet played. It
      is used to make seek operations responsive. This implies also to discard
      an outstanding flush request and any information from <tt>OUTPUT_OPEN</tt>
      calls, except for the last one.</p>
    <p>This message should immediately release a thread waiting at <tt>output_request_buffer</tt>
      for data to be played. This is essential to stop playback while in paused
      mode.</p>
    <p>If the target is a sound device, the output plugin should usually
      immediately respond with an <tt>OUTEVENT_LOW_WATER</tt> event, because
      there are no more buffers to play at the moment.<b><code></code></b></p>
    <h5><tt>OUTPUT_VOLUME</tt> - changes the volume of an output device</h5>
    <p>On this call the <tt>Volume</tt> field contains the new volume setting.
      The change should apply as soon as possible. </p>
    <p>The values are in the range [0,1]. The scale should behave like a volume
      control of a hi-fi unit, i.e. it should not use a linear scale. If your
      hardware or API has a linear scale, you could use the approximation <var>linscale</var>
      = <var>value</var>&nbsp;/&nbsp;(1&nbsp;+&nbsp;sqrt(10)&nbsp;*&nbsp;(1&nbsp;-&nbsp;<var>value</var>)).</p>
    <p>PM123 since 1.41 will no longer call this function before <tt>OUTPUT_OPEN</tt>.</p>
    <h5><tt>OUTPUT_PAUSE</tt> - pauses or resume the playback</h5>
    <p>The command should immediately pause or resume playback, depending on the
      <tt>Pause</tt> field in the control structure. If playback is paused the
      plugin should sooner or later block in <a href="#output_request_buffer"><tt>output_request_buffer</tt></a>
      if the buffers become filled.</p>
    <h5><tt>OUTPUT_CLOSE</tt> - immediately stop playback and close the audio
      device</h5>
    <p>There are two cases, when <tt>OUTPUT_CLOSE</tt> can arrive.</p>
    <ol>
      <li>The output has sent <tt>OUTEVENT_END_OF_DATA</tt>.<br>
        In this case no more samples are passed to the output and the device
        could safely be closed.</li>
      <li>The user aborts playback.<br>
        Any thread blocked at <a href="#output_request_buffer"><tt>output_request_buffer</tt></a>
        or <a href="#output_commit_buffer"><tt>output_commit_buffer</tt></a><em>must
be
          released immediately</em>. This is essential to stop playback while in
        paused mode. <tt>output_request_buffer</tt> should return &#8804;&nbsp;0 in
        this case.</li>
    </ol>
    PM123 will not call <a href="#output_uninit"><tt>output_uninit</tt></a>
    unless the decoder thread really returned.<br>
    <h5>Events</h5>
    <ol>
      <li>The output plugin <em>must</em> call the event handler <b><code>output_event</code></b>
        with the parameter <b><code>OUTEVENT_PLAY_ERROR</code></b> when a
        playback error occurs. This will stop the playback, but it is not
        guaranteed that this is done immediately.</li>
      <li>The output plugin must call <code>output_event</code> with <b><code>OUTEVENT_END_OF_DATA</code></b>
        when the last sample is really processed. This must not be done unless
        the function <code>output_play_samples</code> has been called with a
        buffer pointer of <code>NULL</code> (flush signal).</li>
      <li>The output plugin may raise the events <b><code>OUTEVENT_LOW_WATER</code></b>
        and <b><code>OUTEVENT_HIGH_WATER</code></b> to signal that the buffers
        are running low or the buffers are getting full respectively. This is
        used by PM123 to control the scheduling priority.</li>
      <li>The event handler may be called from any thread in any context.</li>
    </ol>
    <h4><a name="data_interface"></a>Data interface</h4>
    <p>The data interface is only used when the control interface is in
      activated state.</p>
    <p>The data interface does not need to be thread safe itself, but it is
      called from a different thread than the <a href="#control_interface">control
        interface</a>.</p>
    <p>The level 3 interface allocates the sample buffers by the plugin rather
      than the data source. This is known to cause less double buffering. The
      buffer size is no longer fixed. The functions <code>output_request_buffer</code>
      and <code>output_commit_buffer</code> have to be called alternately.
      Anything else is an error. </p>
    <p>All samples are passed as 32 floating point regardless what type the
      input has been.</p>

      <li><tt><var>format</var></tt> - format of buf.<br>
        This may change during playback but not within a buffer. </li>
      <li><tt><var>buf</var></tt> [out] - pointer to a storage area where the
        samples should be placed. A value of <code>NULL</code> indicates that
        there are no more samples to come (flush signal). </li>
      <li><var>return value</var> - the number of samples that fit in the
        returned buffer. The buffer size in bytes is this value multiplied by
        the number of channels and <code>sizeof(float)</code>. Return values
        &#8804;&nbsp;<tt>0</tt> signals a fatal error, except for the flush signal
        which always returns zero. </li>
    </ul>
    <p>This function is called by the decoder or last in chain filter plugin to
      store samples for playing. The function call may block until enough buffer
      space is available. </p>
    <p>After a <em>flush request</em> (<tt><var>buf</var></tt> == <code>NULL</code>)
      there is no need to call <code>output_commit_buffer</code>. The flush
      signal should be used to play any internal buffers regardless if they are
      completely full or not.<br>
      Note that the flush signal is an implicit request for an <code>OUTEVENT_END_OF_DATA</code>
      event. The <code>output_request_buffer</code> call shall not block until
      all buffers are played.<br>
      Do not close the output if you receive a flush request. The user could use
      navigation commands to resume playback while the flush request already is
      in the processing queue.</p>

      <li><tt><var>len</var></tt> - used length of buffer in samples.<br>
        The length might be less than the length returned at <code>output_request_buffer</code>.
        This does not mean that it is a good advise to play a buffer smaller
        than usual unless you receive a flush signal. A length of 0 is not an
        error but an undo request to the previous <code>output_request_buffer</code>
        call. </li>
      <li><tt><var>pos</var></tt> = position marker to return with <code>output_playing_pos</code>.
        This is a time index of the starting point of this buffer in seconds.
        The time position marker may have a large offset far beyond the length
        of the current file. </li>
    </ul>
    <p>This functions are called by the decoder or last in chain filter plugin
      to play the stored samples. </p>
    <h4><a name="status_interface"></a>Status interface</h4>
    <p>The status interface must be thread safe and re-entrant.</p>
    <blockquote>
      <pre>PM123_TIME DLLENTRY <b>output_playing_pos</b>(struct OUTPUT_STRUCT* <var>a</var>)</pre>
    </blockquote>
    This function returns the <tt><var>pos</var></tt> from the buffer that the
    user currently hears. The return value is a time index in seconds. The
    plugin may use its knowledge to calculate the time with higher resolution
    than one buffer. But you must not make any assumptions about the zero point.

        relative to the current playing position. The value might be negative to
        request samples that already have been played, but the output plugin
        might not support this.<br>
        If in doubt pass zero, then all returned samples will be in the future,
        well for an infinitesimal small time. ;-)</li>
      <li><tt><var>cb</var></tt> - Callback that receives the data currently
        played. In general there is more than one callback if the audio buffer

        error. The callback will not be used in case of an error. </li>
    </ul>
    This function is used by visual plugins so the user can visualize what is
    currently being played. It requests the currently playing samples
    asynchronously. The callback may be invoked after <tt>output_playing_samples</tt>
    returned without an error from a different thread, at a different priority
    and from a synchronized context. Each successful call to <tt>output_playing_samples</tt>
    creates exactly one callback with <tt>done = TRUE</tt>.

        the the format might change between invocations of the callback if the
        source format changed at a certain time index. </li>
      <li><tt><var>samples</var></tt> - Sample data. The samples of multi
        channel output is multiplexed. The buffer size depends on the number of
        channels (see <var><tt>format</tt></var>). The buffer is only valid for
        the time of the callback. </li>
      <li><tt><var>count</var></tt> - Number of samples in the buffer. <var><tt>count</tt></var>
        might be <tt>0</tt> with <tt><var>done</var> = TRUE</tt> in case of
        late errors, e.g if the output has stopped. </li>
      <li><tt><var>pos</var></tt> - Time index of the first sample with an
        arbitrary offset.</li>
      <li><var><tt>done</tt></var> - Flag that indicates that this is the last
        callback and the plugin has no more data. The callee may also explicitly
        set this flag to <tt>TRUE</tt> to abort the traversal of audio buffers
        if it received sufficient data. </li>
    </ul>
    <h3><a name="level_1"></a>Interface revision level 0 and 1 (deprecated)</h3>
    <p>This interface revisions should not be used for development because the
      implementations tends to modify the current thread's priority to boost the
      speed of the data source. This implies that the current thread while
      calling <code>output_play_samples</code> is the bottleneck and that it is
      always the same thread. Both is not true in general (e.g. remote data
      sources). </p>

    <p> This function is used by visual plugins so the user can visualize what
      is currently being played. <tt><var>len</var></tt> is usually in the
      order of 2048 samples or less. So check that amount usually required by
      your visual plugins before making complicated buffering functions in your
      output plugin.</p>
